//! What crosses JNI, as msgpack maps with string keys
//! (`rmp_serde::to_vec_named`). Java reads and writes them with its own
//! small codec (`MsgPack.java`), so the shapes stay flat: strings, integers,
//! booleans, arrays of maps. Addresses and message ids travel as lowercase
//! hex, the form the screen shows and hands back.
//!
//! # Version 1
//!
//! Java to Rust:
//!
//! | call | payload |
//! |---|---|
//! | `start` | [`Start`] |
//! | `command` | [`Request`], tagged by `t`: `open`, `close`, `send`, `react`, `reply`, `forward`, `delete`, `used`, `pull`, `front`, `link`, `unlink`, `notnow`, `rename`, `relink` |
//! | `query` | [`Query`], tagged by `t`: `conversations`, `messages`, `info`, `recents`, `suggest`, `contact`, `links` |
//! | `renderMapInto` | [`MapRequest`], and the Bitmap to draw into (null for a prefetch) |
//!
//! Rust to Java:
//!
//! | call | answer |
//! |---|---|
//! | `start` | [`Started`] |
//! | `command` | [`Done`] |
//! | `query` | [`Conversations`], [`Messages`], [`Info`], [`Recents`], [`Suggestions`], [`Addresses`] or [`Links`], or [`Done`] with the error |
//! | `nextEvent` | [`Event`], tagged by `t`: `changed`, `notice`, `sync`, `link`, `stopped`; none when the wait ran out |
//! | `renderMapInto` | [`MapShown`]; its `w` times `h` RGBA pixels are in the Bitmap |
//!
//! The map's pixels do not cross as bytes (1155): Rust composes them
//! straight into the Bitmap Java hands over, locked through the NDK's
//! jnigraphics, so twenty megabytes of a phone's frame are neither copied
//! into a Java `byte[]` nor from there into the Bitmap. The host's tests
//! read the frame as [`frame`] lays it out: four bytes big endian, the
//! length of a [`MapShown`], the [`MapShown`], and its pixels. The map
//! call needs no session: it draws the regions in the
//! app's maps directory and the pins the store knows, with or without one.
//! A change that Java cannot read is a new [`VERSION`]: every answer
//! carries it, and Java refuses one it does not know. A field or an event
//! added is no such change: Java reads keys by name and skips an event it
//! does not know, so `link` (event and field) came within version 1, and a
//! code with the address behind it in [`Start::code`] is still a string,
//! and the avatar's `initials`, `icon_fg` and `icon_bg` (1129) are fields,
//! as are the list row's `kind`, `reaction` and `state` and the list's
//! own `address` and `initials` (1130).
//! A request added is none either: an older app never sends `front`, and
//! the session then counts itself in the back, pulling on wakes and its
//! schedule as before. The map's margins and `moving` (1131) are such
//! fields too: an app that sends none gets the frame of the screen. The
//! long press's requests and queries (1137) and a row's `key` and quote
//! came the same way, and so did the address book's (1139): the link
//! requests and queries, a row's `photo` and `linked`, and the header's
//! link fields; and the map's `prefetch` with its answer's `prefetching`
//! and `prefetched` (1135).
