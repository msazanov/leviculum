//! `loquax --daemon`: the home node (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-home-node.md`).
//!
//! Headless, the 2026-08-08 option C (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-architecture.md`,
//! "process model"): the engine, the store and the router against the local
//! shared instance, and no screen. It
//!
//! - receives as the messenger does: the delivery destination of the home
//!   identity, announced at start and every [`ANNOUNCE_EVERY`], so senders
//!   deliver DIRECT and get their proof;
//! - archives every received message, packed as it came, under a sequence
//!   ([`crate::store::Store::archive_append`]), within the configured cap;
//! - answers its admitted clients on `loquax.home` ([`super::server`]);
//! - collects from its propagation node on the messenger's own schedule
//!   ([`crate::sync::Schedule`]), so mail that senders propagated arrives
//!   too;
//! - delivers what its clients hand in with `/send`, by the outbox policy
//!   of [`super::outgoing`]: direct at once, a propagated copy on failure,
//!   direct retries on every announce of the recipient and on a slow
//!   cadence, each state change an archive entry;
//! - wakes every client that keeps a watching link ([`super::wake`]) when
//!   the archive grows, so it pulls at once rather than on its schedule;
//! - archives the announced name of a peer the user has a relation to
//!   ([`super::relation`]), and of no other, and wakes nobody for it: a
//!   name rides along with the next pull (1136).
