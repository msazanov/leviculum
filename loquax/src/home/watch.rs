//! A client's watching link (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-home-node.md`, "The
//! wake"): one link to `loquax.home`, kept while the client runs, that
//! asked `/watch` and hears a wake whenever the home node's archive grew.
//! The frontend pulls on a wake past its cursor ([`wants_pull`]); the pull
//! itself is the `/sync` it always was, on a link of its own.
//!
//! The link is opened again with [`Backoff`] when it drops or never came
//! up. While it is down the frontend falls back to pulling ([`Fallback`]),
//! besides its open, its Refresh and its schedule. A home node from before
//! `/watch` answers nothing: the request runs out of time, the backoff
//! grows to [`Backoff::MAX`], and the client pulls as it always did.
