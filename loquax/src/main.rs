//! `loquax` binary: the terminal LXMF messenger described in
//! `docs/src/concepts/loquax.md`. With no subcommand it is the conversation
//! view (`tui`, with the `tui` feature); the subcommands are the paths for
//! scripts:
//!
//! ```sh
//! echo "disk 91%" | loquax send <address> --title "backup"
//! loquax fetch
//! ```
//!
//! It attaches to a running `lnsd` or `rnsd` shared instance the way `lnomad`
//! does, runs one command through its own LXMF router and exits. A send that
//! worked prints nothing at all; errors go to stderr. It never starts a
//! Reticulum stack of its own, and it never claims a message was delivered.
//!
//! Exit codes extend `lnomad`'s convention (`lnomad/src/main.rs:174`, `:188`,
//! `:222`): 0 success, 1 operational failure, 2 argument error — plus 3,
//! "a propagation node holds the message", which `--via auto`'s fallback and
//! `--via propagated` return so a script can tell the two successes apart
//! (`loquax/src/send.rs`, `EXIT_PROPAGATED`).
