//! The message store: conversations, messages and their ledgers across
//! restarts, in SQLite (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-storage.md`, "Decision
//! (2026-08-10)"), at `${LNMSG_HOME}/history.sqlite3`.
//!
//! The model says what changed ([`crate::ui::history::StoreWrite`]); this
//! file writes it, one transaction a fold, and reads the history back at
//! start ([`Store::restore`]), a page at a time further back
//! ([`Store::earlier`]), and through its FTS5 index ([`Store::search`]).
//!
//! # The schema
//!
//! The page's starting point, with its three commitments: every row is
//! scoped by our own address (`identity`), a message keeps the sender's
//! clock (`timestamp`) apart from ours (`received_at`), and `fields` is raw
//! msgpack. Where it differs:
//!
//! - **The key is the screen's message counter** (`seq`, the model's
//!   [`Message::activity`]), not `(id, identity)`: a message we write has
//!   no LXMF id until the router queued it, and a send that falls back to a
//!   mailbox gets a second one. The id is a column, indexed.
//! - **The ledger is a table of its own**, a row a line, deleted with its
//!   message; the delivery ledger shares the message's retention (the
//!   page's "Retention").
//! - **Conversations are a table** for what is the conversation's and not a
//!   message's: the pin and the unread count. Names heard from announces
//!   are one more, so a peer keeps its name across a restart.
//! - **`fields` is filled, `title` and `timestamp` stay empty for now**:
//!   the engine's `Received` event carries the fields, which the store keeps
//!   whole as one raw msgpack map; it does not carry the sender's time, and
//!   the screen drops the title. The columns are there so filling them is no
//!   migration.
//! - **Positions are a table** (`positions`, schema 2): every position a
//!   telemetry field carried, keyed by who measured and the fix time, so the
//!   same fix arriving directly and again in a collector's stream is one row
//!   (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, "Stored where"). The wire's
//!   integers go in as they are.
//! - **Unverified messages keep their bytes** (`unverified`, schema 3): a
//!   received message whose sender's key was not known, as it came, so its
//!   signature can be checked when the key arrives, in this run or a later
//!   one (leviculum 1079). The row goes once the verdict is in, which
//!   `messages.verification` then holds: 0 unverified, 1 verified, 2
//!   invalid. A message stored unverified before schema 3 has no bytes kept
//!   and stays unverified: the signature was never stored.
//!
//! - **The home node's archive is a table** (`archive`, schema 4): on a
//!   home node (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-home-node.md`) every received
//!   message is appended as it came, packed, under a sequence that only
//!   grows (`AUTOINCREMENT`, so a sequence is never handed out twice, even
//!   after the newest entry was evicted). Its clients pull it by cursor. The
//!   admitted devices and the open admission tokens are two more tables.
//! - **The home node's outbox is a table** (`home_outbox`, schema 5): every
//!   message a client handed in with `/send`, signed and packed once, with
//!   its state, so a restart keeps retrying it. Each state change is an
//!   archive entry as well, written in the same transaction.
//! - **Imported history sits below seq 0** (schema 6, `crate::import`): a
//!   conversation's imported rows are older than what loquax wrote, so they
//!   take negative keys below the store's lowest, in the source's time
//!   order, and say where they came from (`origin`) and what the source app
//!   thought of their signature (`origin_verdict`), never as our verdict
//!   (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-import.md`). The model counts its keys
//!   unsigned, so the store hands it `seq` with the sign bit flipped
//!   ([`key_of`]): the order is the same, seq 0 is [`KEY_OF_SEQ_ZERO`].
//!
//! # Versions
//!
//! Schema 1 is the store of slice 6; schema 2 adds `positions`, schema 3
//! `unverified`, schema 4 the home node's three tables, schema 5 its
//! outbox and schema 6 the two provenance columns of imported messages,
//! nothing else, so
//! an older file is migrated in place at open, in one transaction. A file newer than this program is refused
//! ([`StoreError::Newer`]): a loquax that knows only schema 1 refuses a
//! schema 2 file, and leaves it as it is.
//!
//! # The durability rule
//!
//! From the page: nothing here may treat a corrupt load as an empty one. A
//! missing file is a first start and makes a fresh store. A file that is
//! there and is not a whole loquax store (not SQLite at all, shorter than
//! its own header says, a schema that is not ours, or newer than this
//! program; SQLite's own checks at open, and the schema's) is refused, with the file named, and loquax does not start over
//! it. Every write is one transaction under SQLite's rollback journal with
//! `synchronous=FULL`, so a crash leaves the store as it was before the
//! write or after it.
//!
//! # Retention
//!
//! As decided: message text and its ledger are kept until the reader
//! deletes them. Attachments, which have the byte budget, do not exist yet.
