//! The map's picture in the terminal (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`,
//! sections 6 and 7, slice (c)): the backend ladder, the region files the
//! reader placed by hand, and the cells the picture and the pins become.
//!
//! The model ([`loquax::ui::map`]) says which view to draw and where the
//! pins go; this module draws the view's picture under them and the
//! attribution line below it.
//!
//! The ladder (1093, Lew 2026-10-28: the most beautiful drawing the
//! terminal can show): kitty or sixel where the terminal answers for one
//! and no mosh or tmux sits between; octants where the terminal draws them
//! itself and the glyphs survive the way there; quadrants and eighth
//! blocks (`blocks`) in a local terminal with 256 colours or more; braille
//! with one-dot lines over cell colours (`braille-thin`) over mosh, in
//! Termux and at 16 colours; plain braille without colour. Half-blocks and
//! the one-colour-a-cell `mosaic` are no rung, only a choice
//! (`docs/drafts/terminal-map-rendering-2026-10.md`). The `--graphics` flag
//! forces a way, `tui.log` names the one taken and why (`GRAPHICS backend=
//! reason=`), beside the `KEYS` line.
//!
//! `t` cycles through every way live, the ones the facts say will not work
//! marked, and the one the reader stays on is remembered per context
//! ([`Facts::context`], the config's `map_drawing.<context>`); a remembered
//! way wins over the ladder at the next start unless it cannot work at all
//! there.
//!
//! The region files, where they are read from, and the frame one view is
//! drawn into are the library's ([`loquax::picture`]), shared with the GUI;
//! the text techniques' encoders are the map core's
//! ([`leviculum_map::cells`]).
