//! `loquax gui`: the window over the same shell and model as the terminal
//! (`docs/src/concepts/gui-toolkit.md`, option B, iced on the desktop;
//! `docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, slice (d)). It opens on the chat
//! ([`chat`], 1145, after the phone's design): the conversations on the
//! left, the open one on the right. The map is its other screen: the peers
//! with a position listed on the left, by the display rule with their fix's
//! age and dimmed when stale, and the map on the right.
//!
//! Two halves on two threads:
//!
//! - The shell ([`crate::shell::Shell`]) runs on the tokio runtime, as in
//!   the terminal: engine, store, sends and fetches, the mailbox's schedule,
//!   the model and its clock. [`drive`] pumps it and ticks it, and after
//!   every change sends what the window shows ([`Seen`]).
//! - The window runs iced on the main thread. It holds only what is the
//!   window's: the map's view at the exact zoom a wheel or a touchpad
//!   leaves and the selected pin, the frame on screen, and the map's
//!   frames ([`loquax::mapframe`], the phone's pipeline, 1144), whose
//!   frames run on iced's executor so a drag never waits for one. A frame
//!   is composed from the tile cache with margins past the screen and
//!   shown where the view moved it until the next lands; while a drag or
//!   the wheel moves the view the names drawn at rest are kept, and at
//!   rest, with the window focused, the cache prefetches around the view.
//!
//! The map's autoload (1089) runs in the shell: the window decides what to
//! ask with the model's own rules ([`want_pins`] when the pins first arrive,
//! [`want_view`] on `d`) and sends it over; the shell's [`Seen`] carries the
//! loading word and the maps directory's epoch, and a new epoch reads the
//! regions again and paints the view anew.
