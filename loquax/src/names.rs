//! Who a peer is on the screen: the name its announces carry, the reader's
//! own name for it, and the trust state that follows from naming
//! (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-mailbox.md`, "Options for naming" and "Trust
//! levels"; `loquax-keys-and-layout.md`, section 7, slice 5).
//!
//! # The display rule
//!
//! The petname if the reader set one, otherwise the name of the address
//! book contact the reader linked the peer to (on a phone, 1139), otherwise
//! the name the peer announced, and in each case the address's first four
//! hex digits after it
//! (`Alice ·4f2a`): the hash is shortened, never suppressed, so "that is not
//! the Alice I know" stays possible at a glance. A peer that announced no
//! name is its address, `<9c31e0a2…>`, as before names arrived.
//!
//! # Names off the wire
//!
//! A name is arbitrary bytes, signed by its holder and claimed by nobody
//! else, so it is sanitised before it is drawn ([`sanitise`]) and never
//! trusted to be unique. Two marks follow from that:
//!
//! - **Collision**: a peer whose shown name looks like another peer's (the
//!   same [`skeleton`]: case, full-width forms and the common Cyrillic,
//!   Greek and digit look-alikes folded) carries [`COLLISION`] after its
//!   hash, both of them, and the header says whose name it shares.
//! - **Name change**: a peer that announces a different name than it did
//!   before in this session; the screen says so once in the conversation
//!   ([`Heard::Changed`]).
//!
//! Neither is a trust state. The pages rejected a derived "suspicious"
//! state: shared names and renames are normal mesh life, and a state that
//! cries wolf on them trains the reader to ignore it.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! Three states, `known` (the reader named the peer, or linked it to a
//! contact of the phone's address book), `unknown` and
//! `blocked`, from the contacts file ([`Contacts`]): `${LNMSG_HOME}/contacts`,
//! one `name <address> <petname>` or `block <address>` a line. The palette's
//! `rename`, `block` and `unblock` write it ([`edit_contacts`]): only the
//! lines about that peer change, every comment and every other line stays
//! as it was, and the file is replaced through a rename ([`save_contact`]).
//!
//! A message from a blocked address is received, proven and stored as any
//! other, so its sender sees it delivered and nothing on the wire tells; the
//! screen leaves it out of the list, the unread count, the toasts and the
//! map (`crate::ui`), and the palette's `blocked` lists those
//! conversations.
//!
//! A name heard is kept in the history store (`crate::store`) and named
//! again after a restart ([`Names::remember`]).
