//! The frontend of `loquax fetch`: drain the selected propagation node's
//! mailbox with the genuine list/fetch/confirm round, print what is new.
//!
//! Like [`crate::send::run_send`], everything here is expressed against
//! [`Outbox`] alone; the actual round — `/get` list, `/get` fetch, the
//! confirming acknowledgement that alone lets the node delete — is the
//! router's (`request_messages_from_propagation_node`,
//! `leviculum-lxmf/src/router/propagation_runtime.rs`), so this module only
//! sequences it and owns what a *user* sees of it.
//!
//! # What is printed, and what is suppressed
//!
//! Every message is recorded in the [`SeenStore`]; only ids the store has
//! never seen are printed. That is the cross-run half of de-duplication —
//! the router already refuses, within one run, to deliver a message twice
//! (its processed-ids set covers the direct and the mailbox path alike), but
//! a fresh process has a fresh router, and the message that arrived directly
//! yesterday must not reappear because a mailbox still held a copy today.
