//! The map on a pixel screen (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, slice (d),
//! and 1128): the picture of a view as RGBA, the map's names set into it,
//! and the pins over it with their labels. The window (`loquax gui`) shows
//! the picture as an iced image and draws its pins on a canvas; the Android
//! app hosts the whole of it, pins included ([`render`]), as one bitmap.
//!
//! The terminal's map counts in cells; this one counts in the screen's own
//! pixels, so the model's map functions ([`crate::ui::map`]: the view,
//! fitting, zooming about a point, dragging) run here with one pixel to
//! a "cell" ([`setup`]). The picture is [`crate::picture`]'s, the label
//! rule [`leviculum_map::pins::labels`] in pixels with the screen's font
//! measuring each label. Everything here is a pure function of its inputs,
//! so every screen and the tests draw through the same code and no test
//! needs a display.
