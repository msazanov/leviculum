//! The map's tile cache (1134, `docs/drafts/map-renderer-roadmap-2026-10.md`,
//! section 5): the map without its names and pins drawn in square tiles of
//! one zoom step's pixel grid, kept in memory by last use, and a screen
//! composed from them at any zoom between the steps.
//!
//! A tile is [`TILE`] pixels of zoom `z` on a side, tile `(x, y)` the
//! pixels `x * TILE ..` and `y * TILE ..` of the world at that zoom, drawn
//! by [`Painter::draw`] as a view of its own. A view of the world is the
//! same pixels however it is cut, so tiles side by side make the picture
//! one view makes, seam for seam. The names are not baked in: they are
//! placed across the whole view in world terms and drawn over the tiles
//! (`crate::mapnames::paint_placed`), as the pins are, so a pin that
//! moves costs no tile and a name never breaks at a seam.
//!
//! A frame takes the tiles its view needs from the cache and draws the
//! missing ones on worker threads, one [`Painter`] each, as many as the
//! host has cores up to [`WORKERS`]. A frame may be told to draw only a
//! few ([`Frame::render_limit`]): the ones it leaves are taken from
//! other zooms' tiles that are cached, scaled, so a pinch that crosses a
//! step keeps showing the map until the new step's tiles land (1143): the
//! coarser steps first, scaled up, the nearest first; where none is held,
//! the finer ones scaled down, 2x2 of the next step or 4x4 of the one
//! after, which is what a zoom out has. Where no cached tile covers a
//! pixel the world outline shows ([`outline::draw`], the theme's
//! colours), and off the projection the theme's water: a frame never
//! shows black.
//!
//! The cache is dropped when the maps directory changes (its epoch) and
//! when the style does (the light or dark table, the line widths of the
//! screen's density). [`BUDGET_MB`] bounds it; a prefetched tile no frame
//! used yet goes first, then the least recently used.
//!
//! A view at rest prefetches (1135): [`plan`] lists the zoom out of the
//! whole frame first after a pinch that went out (1143), the ring of tiles
//! around the frame, then the next zoom in over its central part, then a
//! second ring, each ordered
//! by the last pan's direction ([`Motion`]), and
//! [`TileCache::prefetch`] draws them a batch a call, within
//! [`PREFETCH_BUDGET`] tiles a plan, never evicting a tile the last frame
//! showed nor one prefetched since.
