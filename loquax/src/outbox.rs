//! The seam between the frontend and the message engine.
//!
//! Decision 1 of the design record (`docs/src/concepts/loquax.md`, 2026-08-08)
//! is "C, built as A first": one process now, **with the router and the store
//! behind an interface** so that daemon mode later is a wiring change and not
//! a rewrite. This module is that interface.
//!
//! It is deliberately a command/event seam rather than a set of methods that
//! return answers. Two reasons, and they are the same two the architecture
//! record gives for the shape of the whole program:
//!
//! * The engine runs inside the driver's tick, under a non-reentrant core
//!   mutex, and everything crossing that boundary is already a non-blocking
//!   queue push (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-architecture.md` §3). A seam shaped
//!   like the traffic that actually crosses it needs no adapter.
//! * A daemon-mode implementation is a socket, and a socket is a command
//!   stream and an event stream. An interface built from request/response
//!   methods would have to be rewritten into this shape the day `loquaxd`
//!   exists, which is exactly what the decision forbids.
//!
//! Nothing here mentions `LxmfRouter`, `ReticulumNode` or a channel type, so
//! [`crate::send`] can be driven by a fake with no network anywhere.
