//! The screen of `loquax tui` as a model: what the reader sees and what a key
//! does to it, with no terminal anywhere (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-ui.md`,
//! sections 1 and 2; `loquax-architecture.md`, "the core must not know it has
//! a terminal").
//!
//! The shape is lnomad's, TEA: [`UiModel`] is the state, [`update`] folds one
//! [`UiEvent`] into it and returns the [`UiEffect`]s the shell is to run, and
//! [`view`] turns the model into what each pane shows. The shell draws that
//! and runs the effects; a test does neither and asserts on the model, the
//! effects and the view directly.
//!
//! Three panes, focus follows the pane: conversations, messages, compose.
//! What a key does is one table, [`crate::keys`]: lnomad's scroll rows in
//! the two command panes, loquax's own rows beside them, each chord with the
//! panes it applies in. The key handler, the help overlay, the footer, the
//! palette's keys and the compose pane's hint all read it
//! (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-keys-and-layout.md`, section 4). Compose takes
//! plain typing; the palette (`:` or `Alt-x`) is layered on top over the
//! shared names in [`leviculum_ui::commands`]. No modes.
//!
//! # What a delivery glyph claims
//!
//! A sent message carries a [`DeliveryState`] from the shared glyph table.
//! The router's states map onto it in [`delivery_of`]. While the frontend's
//! send runner is still working on a message, a giving-up state is held
//! back: `--via auto` cancels or loses its direct leg and then uploads the
//! same text to a mailbox, and a `✗` drawn for the leg would be a lie about
//! the message. The `✗` appears when the runner reports it gave up
//! ([`UiEvent::SendDone`] with an error).
//!
//! # The layout
//!
//! Signal's shape in cells (`loquax-keys-and-layout.md`, section 5): the list
//! with two rows a conversation, most recent first; the open conversation as
//! blocks, ours flush right and theirs flush left, with a date line between
//! days and a `new` rule where the unread begins; a detail view per message
//! with what this device saw happen to it. The model knows the screen's size
//! ([`UiEvent::Resize`]) and the time of day ([`UiEvent::Clock`]), because
//! where a block wraps and what a page is depend on the one, and every time on
//! screen on the other; [`layout`] turns a conversation into rows.
//!
//! # The mouse
//!
//! Section 5's table, "What the mouse does": [`UiEvent::Mouse`] carries a
//! click, a wheel turn, a drag or a move at a cell, and [`hit`] says what is
//! drawn there from the same layout the view draws, so a click lands on what
//! the reader sees. The two targets that transmit, `send` on the compose
//! box's border and the mailbox state in the header, run the same commands
//! as `Enter` and `F5`. A drag over the conversation selects text and its
//! release copies it ([`UiEffect::Copy`], OSC 52 in the terminal). On the
//! map a drag moves the view with the pointer and a click opens the pin it
//! went down and came up on ([`map::MapPress`]); the wheel zooms about the
//! pointer, and tilted sideways pans an eighth as `h` and `l` do.
//!
//! # History
//!
//! The conversations, their messages and ledgers, the pins and the names
//! heard outlive the process in the shell's store ([`history`]): the model
//! starts from what it hands back ([`UiModel::restore`]) and says after each
//! fold what changed ([`UiModel::take_writes`]). The top of a conversation
//! is the top of the store (`nothing earlier on this device`), or says how
//! much more the store holds above what is loaded. A message is deleted from
//! the device with `d` and `y`, a conversation from the palette, and the
//! palette's `pin` puts a conversation above the list's rule.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! QR codes are a later slice.
//!
//! # Names
//!
//! A peer is drawn as [`crate::names::Names::label`] says, everywhere: the
//! petname or the announced name with the short hash, `≈` when another
//! peer's name looks the same, the address while it has none. The header
//! adds the trust state in words, and a changed name is a line in the
//! conversation ([`Note`]). The palette's `rename` names the open
//! conversation's peer, `block` and `unblock` set its block, and `blocked`
//! lists the blocked conversations, which the list, the search, the map, the
//! unread counts and the toasts otherwise leave out ([`contacts`]).
//!
//! # The search
//!
//! `/` or `Ctrl-s` turns the list pane into the search ([`search`]): its
//! field on top, the results under it as the query is typed, the plain
//! list while the field is empty. A result opens with `Enter` or a click,
//! a message's at that message with the match marked in its block, and
//! while the search is open `n`/`N` and `Ctrl-s`/`Ctrl-r` step the matches
//! of the open conversation in place. `Esc` closes it and the list comes
//! back; the conversation keeps what it showed.
//!
//! # The map
//!
//! The palette's `map`, `M` or `Alt-m` puts the map in the conversation
//! pane's place ([`map`]): a pin per peer with a known position, fitted on
//! open, zoomed with `+` and `-`, panned with the arrows or `h` `j` `k`
//! `l`, refitted with `0`. `Tab` steps the pins, `Enter` or a click on one
//! opens its conversation, `Esc` brings the conversation back. The list
//! stays beside it. The shell draws the picture for the view the model
//! makes; the model places the pins, so what a click hits is what is drawn.
