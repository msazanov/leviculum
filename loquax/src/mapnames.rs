//! The map's names on a pixel screen (`docs/drafts/map-renderer-roadmap-2026-10.md`,
//! section 1, "Placement" and "Fonts"): set into the picture's raster once,
//! when the view is at rest, so they ride along with it and cost nothing a
//! frame. Placed by the map core's one rule ([`leviculum_map::labels::place`])
//! in screen pixels, after the pins and their names, which nothing covers.
//! The window (1100) and the Android app (1128) set them through this one
//! module.
//!
//! Places, waters and parks are set centred on their anchor; a street's
//! or a river's name on the middle of the longest run of its line (its
//! pieces joined by the map core) that turns less than [`STRAIGHT_DEG`] a
//! vertex, or where that is taken further along it or on the next run, at
//! the run's angle and turned to read left to right, with
//! squares along its baseline as its boxes (the study's first step;
//! bending text along curves is later). Rivers are blue and slanted, the
//! font's own glyphs sheared, since the font has no italic here. Every name
//! carries a halo of the map's ground colour, its glyphs' coverage widened
//! by [`HALO`] pixels and drawn first.
//!
//! The text is shaped by cosmic-text and rasterised by swash in Fira Sans,
//! the face iced embeds, carried here as `fonts/FiraSans-Regular.ttf` (the
//! same file, under the SIL Open Font License, `fonts/OFL.txt`): one font
//! on every host and on the phone, so a picture and its golden agree.
