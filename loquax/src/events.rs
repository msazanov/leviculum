//! The structured event log.
//!
//! `docs/src/concepts/loquax-architecture.md` §7 asks for one line per protocol
//! transition in the `EVENT_NAME key=val t=<ms>` form of
//! `docs/src/structured-event-logs.md`, and calls it cheap rather than
//! speculative. It is: the emit sites are `tracing::debug!` calls carrying an
//! `event` field, and `leviculum_std::event_log::install_global_subscriber`
//! turns `LEVICULUM_EVENT_LOG=<path>` into an append-only file of exactly that
//! format — the same switch `lnsd` honours, so one merged timeline can hold
//! the daemon's packets and the messenger's message states side by side.
//!
//! Each event name below has a matching entry in
//! `leviculum_std::event_log::EVENT_CATALOG`, which is what makes a missing
//! key a loud `EVENT_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` line rather than a quiet gap.
