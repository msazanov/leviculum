//! The in-process message engine: an [`LxmfRouter`] driven from inside the
//! driver's tick, and the [`Outbox`](crate::outbox::Outbox) the frontend
//! sees it through.
//!
//! # Why the engine is a `CoreProcessor`
//!
//! `leviculum-std`'s public event stream classifies before it delivers, and
//! seven of the event types LXMF needs — `PacketReceived` and
//! `LinkDataReceived` among them, i.e. how a message *arrives* — are
//! `EventClass::Data` and droppable under load
//! (`leviculum-std/src/driver/processor.rs`, "Where the events come from").
//! A client fed from there would silently lose messages with nothing
//! underneath to retransmit them, so the tap is the only correct feed
//! (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-architecture.md` §3). This slice only sends, but
//! the feed is the same one the reading half will need, and picking the wrong
//! one now would have to be undone later.
//!
//! # The rule this file is written against
//!
//! Both hooks run **with the core mutex held, and that mutex is not
//! reentrant**. So this type owns no `ReticulumNode` and no handle derived
//! from one, and every side effect is a push onto an unbounded queue. Nothing
//! here does I/O, and the one unbounded computation in LXMF — proof-of-work
//! for a stamp — leaves through a queue and is mined by the host, the
//! terminal on a thread of its own ([`mine`] is what every host runs).
//!
//! # The core and the shell
//!
//! This file is the core, `no_std` plus `alloc`, and generic over the node
//! core (`NodeCore<R, C, S>`). The `CoreProcessor` impl for the driver's
//! `StdNodeCore`, the channels to the frontend ([`InProcessOutbox`]),
//! [`attach`], the stamp worker thread, its tokio runtime and `OsRng` are
//! the shell, in `engine/shell.rs` behind the `std` feature.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! No persistence. `LxmfRouter::persist` writes the outbound queue to an
//! `LxmfStorage`, and a `FileLxmfStorage` for it exists
//! (`leviculum-std/src/file_lxmf_store.rs:27`) — but in this slice nothing
//! would ever drain a restored queue, since there is no daemon and no
//! `loquax sync`. Persisting would buy a file on disk that no code reads, at
//! the price of a write inside the core lock. The moment daemon mode or a
//! resume path exists, this is where it goes.
