//! The map on a pixel screen frame by frame (1134, 1135, 1144): what the
//! phone's map screen and the window share between the view a frontend
//! keeps and the RGBA it shows.
//!
//! A frontend keeps an [`ExactView`], the zoom between the steps a pinch
//! or a wheel leaves, held to one world and the regions' zooms by
//! [`hold`], and asks [`Frames::frame`] for it with the pins and whether
//! the view is moving ([`Ask`]). The frame is drawn with margins past the
//! screen, so a pan reveals drawn map while the next frame is drawn. The
//! map comes from [`TileCache`]: the tiles of the step nearest the zoom,
//! scaled to it, and while the view moves the step the last frame was
//! composed from as long as the zoom is within a step of it, with at most
//! [`MOVING_TILES_PER_WORKER`] missing tiles drawn a worker, the rest
//! shown from cached steps and owed ([`Shot::missing`]: ask again).
//!
//! The names are placed at rest, over the frame after the pins, and kept
//! as sprites; a frame while the view moves draws them where the view
//! moved them ([`moved`]), so they never leave the picture. The pins are
//! placed in every frame, and drawn in unless the frontend sets them
//! itself ([`Ask::draw_pins`]).
//!
//! A frame at rest that owes no tile leaves the view to prefetch (1135):
//! [`Frames::prefetch`] then draws one batch of [`tiles::plan`]'s tiles a
//! call, one a worker, ordered by the pan's direction ([`Motion`], fed by
//! [`Frames::pan`] and [`Frames::zoom`]), up to the plan's budget. Any
//! frame drops the plan; the next frame at rest makes a new one.
//!
//! The cache drops its tiles when the maps directory's epoch or the style
//! changes (the theme, the screen's density), so a frontend needs no
//! invalidation of its own.
