//! Bringing a user's identity, contacts and history over from the messenger
//! they used before (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-import.md`; the survey is
//! `docs/drafts/loquax-import-2026-10.md`).
//!
//! Slice 1 reads raw 64-byte identity files of every app that writes one
//! (NomadNet, MeshChat and MeshChatX, Sideband, Ratspeak's unsealed file),
//! a pasted Base32 key, and NomadNet's whole tree: contacts, blocks, the
//! propagation node and the history. The loquax export writes NomadNet's
//! tree (`crate::export`), so the same reader takes it back.
//!
//! Ratspeak's history comes from a copy of its `ratspeak.db` the user names
//! ([`ratspeak`], 1150, 1158): two schemas, lossy, every row marked as imported
//! with no signature. On a Loquax Mailbox the imported rows go into the
//! archive too ([`archive`]), so its clients take them on their next pull.
//!
//! # The boundary
//!
//! The scan looks only at the apps' documented default locations, one level
//! deep, and reads no more than the line it shows needs: an identity file
//! for the address, directory listings for the counts. A path the user
//! names is read as whatever it turns out to be. Nothing here logs key
//! material or message content; the log (`import.log` beside the store)
//! names paths, addresses and counts.
//!
//! # The three questions
//!
//! Contacts (with names and the propagation node), default yes; history,
//! default yes; the identity, default no, adopted only on a typed `yes`
//! after the warning about running both apps on one identity. Lew,
//! 2026-10-29: the old identity is set aside and kept, and its history stays
//! in the store under its address; `retain_synced_on_node` is not offered.
//!
//! History is written under the address it belongs to (rows are scoped by
//! identity, `crate::store`): it is the live history once that identity is
//! loquax's, and waits in the store until then.
