//! The reader's word on a conversation besides its messages (1146): pin,
//! mute, archive, block, and the peer's identity verified in person.
//!
//! Pin, mute, archive and block are one [`PeerState`], set whole: on a
//! client of a home node every change goes to the home node as well, which
//! hands it to the home's other devices on their next pull, so the laptop
//! and the phone hide, pin and silence the same people. Verified stays on
//! the device that compared the key.
//!
//! A muted conversation counts its unread and raises nothing: no toast
//! here, no notification on the phone. An archived one leaves the list for
//! the archived view; a new message brings it back unless it is muted, as
//! Signal does. A blocked one is hidden as the palette's `block` hides it
//! ([`super::contacts`]).
