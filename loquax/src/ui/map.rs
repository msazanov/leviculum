//! The map view as a model (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, section 1,
//! "The map view", and slice (c)): which pins there are, in which order
//! `Tab` steps them, where the view is and where each pin lands in cells.
//!
//! The model knows no pixels of its own. The shell tells it how many image
//! pixels one cell carries for the backend it drew with, and which zooms
//! its installed regions reach ([`MapSetup`]); from those and the pane's
//! cells the model makes the [`Viewport`] the shell draws, and places the
//! pins in the cells the reader clicks. So a click and the frame cannot
//! disagree, and a test of the model needs no terminal.
//!
//! A pin is a peer with a known position, our own among them when one is
//! known, named by the display rule ([`crate::names::Names::label`]) with
//! the fix's age beside it, dimmed once it is stale
//! ([`crate::telemetry::STALE_AFTER_SECS`]).
