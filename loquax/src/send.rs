//! The frontend of `loquax send`: everything the command does, expressed
//! against [`Outbox`] alone.
//!
//! Nothing in this module knows about Reticulum, LXMF, channels or a terminal.
//! That is what makes the whole command testable without a network, and it is
//! the same boundary the architecture record demands of the eventual TUI —
//! "the core must not know it has a terminal", decided 2026-08-08
//! (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-architecture.md` §4).
//!
//! # What exit 0 is allowed to mean
//!
//! Decision 7 says exit 0 means "queued cleanly" and claims nothing more; that
//! half is untouched and is what this module exists to keep true. Its other
//! half — return immediately, with the message id on stdout — is gone: the id
//! came off stdout on 2026-08-21 (a success now prints nothing), and the
//! immediate return did not survive contact with the process model decided two
//! days before the decision. In option A there is no daemon, so the process
//! that holds the outbound queue is the process that is about to exit. A
//! literal immediate return would report success and then destroy the queue
//! that success referred to, which is a worse lie than the one the decision
//! was written to prevent.
//!
//! So this waits — bounded, and for the earliest thing that makes the claim
//! true rather than for a delivery proof. The message is *handed on* when the
//! router reports [`MessageState::Sent`] (the bytes went to Reticulum),
//! [`MessageState::Delivered`] (a transport proof came back) or
//! [`MessageState::AwaitingCollection`] (a propagation node took it). Any of
//! those ends the run at once, so a working send does not block until a proof
//! arrives, which is what decision 7 was protecting. The deviation is recorded
//! in the batch report.
//!
//! `Delivered` is a Reticulum transport proof and not an application receipt
//! (`loquax-architecture.md` §2, trap 3), so no word this program prints is
//! ever "delivered to" a person.
