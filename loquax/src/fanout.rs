//! One engine, several readers: the TUI's screen and the send or fetch
//! runner working for it.
//!
//! The runners ([`crate::send::run_send_auto`], [`crate::fetch::run_fetch`])
//! each take an [`Outbox`] and read its events to the end of their run, as
//! they do for the CLI. The TUI runs them unchanged, the same code the CLI's
//! `send` and `fetch` run, while its screen reads the same events: a
//! delivery glyph moves on the very `State` event the runner waits for, and a
//! message received mid-send must reach the screen and not die in the
//! runner's ignore arm. So the shell keeps the engine's outbox to itself and
//! hands each runner a [`Tap`]: every engine event is copied to every live
//! tap and returned to the screen, and a tap's commands go to the engine.
//!
//! The engine says `Ready` once per process and [`crate::send::run_send`]
//! waits for it before it resolves, so a tap opened later is handed the
//! `Ready` the fan-out kept.
