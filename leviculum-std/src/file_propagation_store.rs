//! File-backed [`PropagationStore`]: one file per stored message
//! (Codeberg #384, part 1).
//!
//! The layout is the reference's message store, one directory of files named
//! `<transient_id_hex>_<received_secs>_<stamp_value>_<sequence>` whose
//! content is `lxmf_data || stamp` (`lxmf_propagation`,
//! `reference/LXMF/LXMF/LXMRouter.py:2512-2515`; re-indexed at startup by
//! `enable_propagation`, `:565-592`). Three local differences: the timestamp
//! is written as integer seconds rather than a float, the stamp-value
//! component is always present (the reference omits it at value 0 and then
//! *skips such files entirely* when re-indexing, `:568` requires three
//! components — a quirk, not a behaviour worth importing), and a fourth
//! component carries the append-order sequence the per-peer sync cursors
//! index (`docs/src/concepts/propagation-node-on-a-board.md` §5) so cursors
//! stay valid across a reopen.
//!
//! The directory is shared with `lxmd` in one direction. `lnpnd` started on
//! an `lxmd` config directory opens the store `lxmd` left there, so [`open`]
//! reads the reference's names as well: `<hex>_<received float>` and
//! `<hex>_<received float>_<stamp_value>`, the receive time truncated to
//! whole seconds and a missing stamp value read as 0 (two-component files
//! are served here although `lxmd` itself would never index them again; a
//! part-1 store of ours is the three-component case too). Such entries are
//! assigned fresh sequences above every known one, in receive-time order,
//! which at worst re-offers them once, and are renamed into our scheme on
//! that first open, so after it the directory is ours. What we write is
//! always our own four-component scheme; `lxmd` would index it unchanged,
//! since it reads only the first three components, and a torn temp file of
//! ours is invisible to both indexers.
//!
//! [`open`]: FilePropagationStore::open
//!
//! # Power-cut safety, and why this store fsyncs
//!
//! The role proves an upload packet only after [`PropagationStore::append`]
//! returns ("persist before you prove",
//! `docs/src/concepts/propagation-node-on-a-board.md` §3): a proof written
//! before the record is durable converts a power cut into a silently lost
//! message, because the client stops retrying. So `append` here is
//! write-to-temp, `fsync`, rename-into-place, `fsync` the directory — after
//! it returns, the message survives the plug being pulled, and a cut at any
//! earlier point leaves only a `.tmp-` file the reopen scan ignores. The
//! generic `atomic_write` helper in `crate::storage` deliberately skips the
//! fsyncs (announce caches and ratchet files tolerate losing the last
//! seconds); this store must not.
//!
//! # Write-behind, and where "persist before you prove" holds then
//!
//! Those two `fsync`s cost 1.0 to 1.8 ms an append on the coder host and 3
//! to 9 ms on the field node's Odroid (order 1009), and `lnpnd` appends from
//! a hook that holds the core lock under a 5 ms budget. So a store switched
//! to [`write_behind`] hands every filesystem change to a writer thread of
//! its own and returns: `append` queues the durable write and hands back a
//! ticket ([`writes_issued`]), and [`settle_writes`] says how far the writer
//! has got. The caller proves an upload once the writer has passed its
//! ticket and the message is still in the store, which moves the boundary
//! the trait documents from `append` to the writer's confirmation, as the
//! board's flush queue does (`leviculum-nrf/pn-store`, "How a synchronous
//! trait meets an asynchronous flash"). The visibility rule is the board's
//! too: a queued append is visible to `contains` and the body reads, so a
//! retry is a duplicate and a `/get` could serve it, but not to `for_each`,
//! so nothing offers, lists or hands a peer cursor a message that a power
//! cut could still take. A write the writer could not make is reported in
//! [`SettledWrites::failed`] and leaves the store, so the caller can forget
//! the id and the client's retry is stored rather than answered as proven.
//!
//! Purges and the removal of a replaced file go through the same queue, in
//! order, so a purge of a queued message runs after its write.
//!
//! [`write_behind`]: FilePropagationStore::write_behind
//! [`writes_issued`]: FilePropagationStore::writes_issued
//! [`settle_writes`]: FilePropagationStore::settle_writes
