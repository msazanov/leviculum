//! Codeberg #65 instrumentation contract: the shape of the LNode debug lines
//! the host side greps.
//!
//! The firmware emits these line shapes on the CDC-ACM debug console:
//!
//! ```text
//! [INFO!] [PANIC_COUNT] total=<u32> t=<ms>                  (boot banner, once per boot)
//! [HEAP] used=<n> free=<n> watermark=<n> size=<n> t=<ms>    (every 30 s)
//! [SX_REG] rxgain_before=0xNN rxgain_after=0xNN txmod=0xNN  (once, end of init_radio)
//! [SX_REG_IQ] iq_before=0xNN iq_after=0xNN txmod=0xNN       (once, first SetPacketParams)
//! [SX_RX_ARM] site=<tag> timeout_ms=<u32> dark_ms=<u64|first>  (every SetRx)
//! [SX_RX_ADOPT] latched=0xNNNN preamble=<0|1> header=<0|1> rxdone=<0|1> stood_ms=<u32>
//! [SX_RX_TEARDOWN] site=<tag> preamble=<0|1> header=<0|1> rxdone=<0|1> armed_ms=<u32> waited_ms=<u64>
//! [SX_RX_HARVEST] site=<tag> preamble=<0|1> header=<0|1> rxdone=<0|1> armed_ms=<u32> waited_ms=<u64>
//! [SX_TX_DEFER] waited_ms=<u64> reason=<preamble|header> outcome=<frame|timeout|abandoned|false_preamble>
//! [BLE ] BLE_DIAL_REFUSED addr=<12 hex> lived_ms=<u64> fallback_in_ms=<u64>  (a dial of ours the peer refused)
//! ```
//!
//! The adopt/teardown pair is read as a rate against each other: an
//! `[SX_RX_ADOPT]` with any flag set is a reception the pre-adoption firmware
//! destroyed, an `[SX_RX_TEARDOWN]` with any flag set is one still being
//! destroyed, and `site=` on the teardown says by which caller. Both are
//! emitted with the flags as read, all-zero included; a line that appeared
//! only when it had bad news would give a numerator with no denominator.
//!
//! `[SX_RX_HARVEST]` is the teardown's other half, at the same `site=` and in
//! the same fields: a window whose reception had already completed when a
//! transmit asked for it, taken rather than destroyed. Read as a fraction of
//! the teardowns carrying `rxdone=1` at that site it is the rate at which that
//! collision still costs a frame — which, after the fix that introduced the
//! line, should be the readout failures and nothing else. The shared field
//! order is why `parse_rx_latch` below takes the tag as an argument.
//!
//! `[SX_TX_DEFER]` is the third of that family and the one that reports a
//! behaviour rather than an observation: a transmit that found a reception
//! arriving on the window it was about to end waited for it instead.
//! `outcome=frame` against `outcome=timeout`, taken per `reason=`, is whether
//! the wait is earning its keep or merely delaying the transmitter — the ratio
//! the guard has to justify itself with, and the reason the line carries the
//! measured `waited_ms` rather than the bound it was allowed.
//! `outcome=false_preamble` is the carrier-detect site's own release: a carrier
//! that showed no header inside the preamble-plus-header time, let go at a
//! tenth of the frame bound rather than at it (Codeberg #426).
//!
//! `waited_ms=` on the teardown and the harvest is the same quantity for the
//! same reason, and it is `0` on every site that does not wait. It is read as
//! an OPTIONAL trailing field below, unlike every other field on those lines:
//! the parser has to keep reading the archived captures and the persistent-log
//! replays of boards on firmware older than #426, which carry the line without
//! it. What guards the emission instead is the format-string pin in
//! `the_firmware_still_emits_both_halves_of_the_adoption_instrument`.
//!
//! The trailing ` t=<ms>` is board uptime at the moment the line was
//! formatted, appended to EVERY runtime line since the drain-latency audit
//! (#344). It is deliberately at the END: every consumer below anchors on a
//! `[TAG]`, and a leading stamp would break all of them at once. The parsers
//! here therefore have to keep working with an unknown-key field appended —
//! which is exactly what `stamp_does_not_disturb_the_existing_parsers` asserts.
//! The stamp is the renderer's alone: a body that appends its own prints `t=`
//! twice, which `no_firmware_log_body_carries_its_own_stamp` refuses (890).
//!
//! Two host-side consumers grep them: `scripts/catch-reboot.sh`, which reports
//! the cause of a reboot caught under sustained LoRa load, and the ad-hoc heap
//! analysis of a debug capture (Codeberg #50 left the peak-load stack question
//! open, so `[HEAP]` is still read by hand). If the firmware changes the shape,
//! both silently grep nothing. These tests fail first.
//!
//! Migrated here from `reticulum-integ/tests/lnode_instrumentation.rs` when
//! that crate was retired. The hardware half of that file — a live listen on
//! every attached LNode's debug port asserting the telemetry really flows —
//! did NOT come with it: periculum captures the debug port but has no step
//! class that asserts on the capture, so there is nowhere to express it. See
//! the retirement ledger.
//!
//! This lives in leviculum-std because the firmware crate cross-compiles to
//! thumbv7em and cannot run host tests, and leviculum-std is the crate that
//! owns host-side communication with a board.
//!
//! `just fast` does not execute this file: it ends at `cargo test --workspace
//! --lib`, and its `check-all-targets` dependency (Codeberg #220) only
//! *compiles* `tests/` targets, so an assertion here first runs in the landing
//! gate's `cargo test --workspace`. A batch that changes what these tests pin
//! — the firmware's log grammar, or the source invariants below — has to name
//! `cargo test -p leviculum-std --test lnode_debug_log_format` itself.

    the arm is entered only on an event produced outside this loop — a daemon \
    dequeue, a host config push — and at that event's rate, never at the loop's \
    own; (b) the call is reached at most once per entry, not from a loop and \
    not twice on one path. The two sites below pass that check, so their waits \
    add at most one maximum-size frame's airtime each and do not compound. The \
    config site needs one step more, because since 2026-09-23 it sits in \
    `rx_window`, which the loop calls at every window it arms: what keeps it at \
    once per push is that a window entered while a config is already waiting is \
    not armed at all, so the first stand-down of a turn is the only one and the \
    turn's top then consumes the config. If a new site passes the check too, \
    name it in the regions below and say here why its cadence is external; if it \
    does not, it must not defer with this bound. A site that cannot pass it may \
    still defer with the other policy: the carrier-detect does, once per CSMA \
    retry, and it pays for that by releasing a bare carrier at a tenth of the \
    bound (Codeberg #426). It is not in this file's regions because it defers \
    inside the driver's own `cad`, not in the loop; the site table that covers \
    every teardown is the mvr \
    `cad_tears_down_the_frame_it_then_detects`.";

/// invariant rather than a number: each site spends the bound once per entry,
/// and each is entered on an event a channel outside this loop wrote, not on
