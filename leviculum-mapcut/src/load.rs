//! A box of an archive, local or remote, cut into a region under a size
//! cap (1089): the tiles are located first, from the directories alone, and
//! when the box's tiles down to the deepest zoom asked would fetch more than
//! the cap, the deepest zoom is lowered until they do not. Only then is
//! anything fetched, in as few ranges as the archive's layout allows.
