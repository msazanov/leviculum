//! `leviculum-mapcut`: makes region files for `leviculum-map` (Codeberg
//! #474, `docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, section 4), for the cut by hand
//! (`leviculum-map-tool cut`) and for the messenger's autoload (`loquax`,
//! 1089) alike: one cut path, not a copy.
//!
//! - [`pmtiles`]: a PMTiles v3 archive read by ranges, from a file or a
//!   server, only the directories and tiles a box needs.
//! - [`http`] (feature `http`): the server, by HTTP range requests.
//! - [`mvt`]: vector tiles to classed geometry, the tree's one MVT decoder.
//! - [`simplify`]: Douglas-Peucker, quantisation, areas, all integer.
//! - [`cut`]: a bounding box and zoom range of a source under a layer
//!   profile, written as a region file.
//! - [`load`]: a box of a remote archive cut into a region under a size
//!   cap, which lowers the deepest zoom rather than asking.
//! - [`serve`]: a loopback HTTP server of archives with range requests,
//!   the map source of the tests.
//!
//! `std`, and in no `no_std` graph: prost and the MVT decoder stay here,
//! out of `leviculum-map` and the loquax core.
