//! `leviculum-map`: the map core every frontend draws through (Codeberg
//! #474, `docs/src/concepts/loquax-map.md`, section 3).
//!
//! - [`region`]: the region file, a tile pyramid of `leviculum-mapfill`'s
//!   flat geometry behind an index, read in place through a [`Storage`].
//! - [`mercator`]: Web Mercator between degrees and a 32-bit world
//!   coordinate.
//! - [`viewport`]: centre, zoom, pan, fit, and the tiles a view needs.
//! - [`profile`]: which classes each zoom of a region keeps, and how its
//!   geometry was simplified.
//! - [`pins`]: pins and their labels placed in a view, as data.
//! - [`draw`]: the tiles of one view drawn into any `DrawTarget`, class by
//!   class across the tiles, through `leviculum-mapfill`, in colour or as
//!   lines alone, at the line widths of the view's zoom.
//! - [`outline`]: the world outline, Natural Earth 1:110m land, where no
//!   region covers the view.
//! - [`choice`]: which installed region a view draws, and the zooms a
//!   frontend offers.
//! - [`style`]: the colour tables, `leviculum-mapfill`'s own.
//!
//! `no_std` with `alloc`; the feature `std` adds only a [`Storage`] for a
//! file. Text is never drawn here: labels are data a frontend places.
