//! One view drawn from its tiles through `leviculum-mapfill`.
//!
//! A tile's features are written in class order, but a view of several
//! tiles cannot be drawn tile after tile: geometry reaches past its tile's
//! edge (the source tiles carry a buffer), and the second tile's areas
//! would paint over the first tile's roads there. So the draw goes class by
//! class across all the tiles of the view, the order a single fixture of
//! the whole view had in the measurement. That needs every tile of the view
//! at hand at once, a few tens of kilobytes at z15 under profile 1.
//!
//! The lines go in three layers, tunnels under the ground's roads under
//! bridges, and under the PC finish ([`Style::PC`]) each layer strokes its
//! casings first, so the casings of a junction join under its fills and a
//! bridge's casing covers the road it crosses.
//!
//! The line widths follow the view zoom ([`crate::profile::line_widths`]),
//! and [`Ink::Lines`] draws the lines alone in one colour, for a terminal
//! that has one colour a cell and no fill (braille).
