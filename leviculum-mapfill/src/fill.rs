//! Scanline polygon fill with integer edges and per-row buckets.
//!
//! The shape is the classic edge-table filler. Every ring edge is turned
//! into an [`Edge`] once: its first pixel row, its last row, its x where it
//! crosses that first row's centre line, and its x step per row, all in
//! 16.16 fixed point. Edges are bucketed by first row, so a row's work is
//! to merge its bucket into the active list, drop the edges that ended,
//! insertion-sort the list by x (it is nearly sorted from the row above)
//! and emit the spans between crossings under the fill rule. No floats, no
//! allocation: the caller lends the edge storage in a [`Scratch`].
//!
//! Sampling rule: pixel `(x, y)` is inside when its centre `(x + 0.5,
//! y + 0.5)` is, and a centre exactly on a left edge is in, on a right edge
//! out. Two polygons that share an edge therefore neither overlap nor leave
//! a gap between them, which is what removes the tile seams outline drawing
//! showed (`docs/drafts/map-measurement-2026-10.md`).
//!
//! The reference read before writing this is the 112-line `fill.rs` of
//! dfyz/osm-renderer (MIT, `src/draw/fill.rs` at 02bd330a). It walks every
//! edge with Bresenham into a map of rows and fills even-odd between pairs
//! of per-row x extents. This one differs where the board needs it to: it
//! samples pixel centres instead of marking every pixel an edge touches, so
//! fills are exact rather than conservative; it carries the winding
//! direction, so nonzero works as well as even-odd; and it keeps its edges
//! in caller-provided slices rather than a hash map.
