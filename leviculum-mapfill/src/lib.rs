//! `leviculum-mapfill`: the one piece of map renderer the vector map needs
//! that `embedded-graphics` 0.8 lacks, a polygon fill (Codeberg #474, #293,
//! `docs/drafts/map-measurement-2026-10.md`).
//!
//! - [`fill`]: a scanline filler with integer edges and per-row buckets,
//!   holes, even-odd and nonzero, drawing spans into any
//!   [`DrawTarget`](embedded_graphics::draw_target::DrawTarget).
//! - [`stroke`]: wide lines as quads through the filler.
//! - [`fixture`]: the flat i16 geometry the host harness cuts from vector
//!   tiles, read in place from flash.
//! - [`render`]: one view from a fixture, phase by phase, under a clock.
//! - [`style`]: the two flat colour tables and the two layer profiles.
//! - [`frame`]: an Rgb565 framebuffer in the ST7789's byte order.
//!
//! `no_std`, no `alloc`, no float: the caller lends every buffer. The host
//! harness is `measure/`, the M9 measurement firmware `m9/`.
