//! Wide lines as quads through the filler.
//!
//! Each segment of a polyline becomes a rectangle `width` across. With
//! square caps it is extended by half the width past both ends, which also
//! closes the wedge at a joint up to a right angle. With round joins it is
//! not extended, and a disc of the line's width goes on every vertex where
//! the line turns, and on both ends: a round cap and a round join in one.
//! All quads and discs are built with the same orientation and filled
//! together under [`FillRule::NonZero`], so where they overlap the windings
//! add and the union is filled once. A dashed line is the same walk with
//! only the pieces of the pattern's "on" lengths turned into quads.
