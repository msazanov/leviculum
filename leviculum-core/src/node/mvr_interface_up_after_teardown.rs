//! mvr (981, 924 follow-up): a stale interface-up notification applied after
//! the interface's teardown re-announces every local destination to an index
//! the core itself already tore down.
//!
//! ## The field record
//!
//! The three `no-such-interface` drops of the second miauhaus soak on
//! 5e1d965, same millisecond, 32.2 h into the run:
//!
//! ```text
//! PKT_DROP node=miauhaus dst=e2fe2806... hops=0 iface_in=None iface_out=223 len=167 reason=no-such-interface type=Announce t=115878166
//! PKT_DROP node=miauhaus dst=07d7d360... hops=0 iface_in=None iface_out=223 len=167 reason=no-such-interface type=Announce t=115878166
//! PKT_DROP node=miauhaus dst=cafa583f... hops=0 iface_in=None iface_out=223 len=193 reason=no-such-interface type=Announce t=115878166
//! ```
//!
//! Own announces (`hops=0`), one per local destination, all addressed to one
//! interface in one tick: the shape of `handle_interface_up`'s Block-D
//! re-announce (`announce_local_destinations`, one fresh announce per
//! daemon-owned destination as an immediate `SendPacket` on that interface
//! alone) — not of 924's grace-held path response, which answers one
//! destination per request. 924's cull cannot reach these: they are never
//! announce-table entries, they are actions emitted after the teardown.
//!
//! The driver race behind it (lnsd, `driver/mod.rs`): a reconnecting
//! auto-connect TCP client's task sends its reconnect notification
//! (`tcp_client_reconnect_loop`, `interfaces/tcp.rs`) in the same second the
//! auto-connect manager's 1 s poll sees the interface offline past
//! `DETACH_THRESHOLD_SECS` (12 s) and retires it — the reconnect backoff and
//! the detach threshold mature on the same timescale after a connection
//! death, so the collision is structurally favoured, not freak. The retire
//! runs `handle_interface_teardown` and removes the interface from the
//! registry; the buffered reconnect event is then drained and
//! `handle_interface_up` re-announces to the dead index, which
//! `dispatch_actions` drops as `no-such-interface`, one drop per local
//! destination, same millisecond. A retired auto-connect id is never reused
//! (it respawns under a fresh id), so the stale index can never be a
//! legitimate later interface.
//!
//! ## What this pins
//!
//! The core keeps a tombstone for every index it tore down
//! (`Transport::mark_interface_torn_down`), cleared when a driver registers
//! the index again (`set_interface_name`, which every registration path
//! calls before `handle_interface_up`). `handle_interface_up` on a
//! tombstoned index announces nothing and says so (`IFACE_UP_STALE`).
//!
//! Host model: one node, deterministic, sub-second, no driver.
