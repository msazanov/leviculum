//! The browser's core: the model, [`update()`], the [`Effect`]s, and the
//! browser's own input and geometry types.
//!
//! The rule this module exists for (`docs/src/concepts/lnmsg-architecture.md`,
//! "the core must not know it has a terminal", Codeberg #219): nothing in here
//! imports `crossterm`, `ratatui` or any other terminal crate. Events come in
//! as [`AppEvent`], effects go out as [`Effect`], and a frontend is a
//! translator and a renderer over that pair. The terminal frontend is
//! [`crate::tui`]; a GUI is a second one, with no change here.
//!
//! The one thing still shaped by the terminal is the unit: positions and
//! rectangles are character cells, and the click and hover hit-tests run here
//! against the cell layout of the chrome ([`chrome`]). A pixel frontend will
//! want semantic events (follow this link, press this control) beside the
//! cell-addressed mouse ones.
