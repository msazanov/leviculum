//! Active delivery from a propagation node: which stored message the node
//! pushes when a destination becomes reachable, and what a failed push
//! leaves behind.
//!
//! The board's engine (`leviculum-nrf/src/pn.rs`, `trigger_active` and the
//! `DeliveryFailed` arm of `on_event`) sends a stored message to its
//! recipient as one opportunistic packet the moment it hears that recipient
//! announce or finds a path to it, without waiting for a `/get`. Both
//! decisions here were inline there until leviculum#413, reachable only by
//! `lora_pn_board_sync` (an 1800 s cell on four radios) for the pick and by
//! no cell at all for the give-up, since none makes a push fail.
//!
//! One message is in flight at a time, so the pick names exactly one.
//!
//! The third decision, what a push the core refuses outright leaves
//! ([`after_refused_push`], [`remember_too_large`]), followed in the third
//! wave of leviculum#413: no cell makes the core refuse a push.
//!
//! The fourth is what a peer that just linked is asked
//! ([`PeerUpSolicit`], [`SolicitPacer`], [`solicit_on_peer_up`],
//! leviculum#849): the push needs a trigger, and a phone that returns to
//! the room gives none of its own.
