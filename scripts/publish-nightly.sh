# Publishes dist/*.deb + *.sha256 to the rolling `nightly` Codeberg
# release. Called from .woodpecker/nightly.yml. Stable download URL:
#   https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/<filename>
#
# The release is rolling: same tag every night, assets overwritten. The
# overwrite is an upload-then-delete swap, never the other way round:
# the previous build stays downloadable until the new one is fully up
# (Codeberg #286). And it stays downloadable after that, one generation
# deep: each asset this run replaces is renamed to `<name>.previous.<ext>`
# before the uploads, and the `.previous` set it displaces is what the swap
# deletes (Codeberg #323). A good build is then still there the morning a bad
# one that passed the gates has replaced it.
# Version info for each build is embedded in the binaries themselves
# (lnsd --version) and in the release body.
#
# Authentication uses a Codeberg API token with `write:repository`
# scope, exposed to the publish step via the Woodpecker secret
# `codeberg_token`. CI_NETRC_PASSWORD (Woodpecker's OAuth-derived
# token) is NOT visible outside the clone step, so a manual token is
# required.
#
# Required env (set by Woodpecker):
#   CI_REPO         — e.g. "Lew_Palm/leviculum"
#   CI_COMMIT_SHA   — current commit
#   CODEBERG_TOKEN  — Codeberg API token (Woodpecker secret)
#   LEVICULUM_BUILD_ID (optional, for release body)
#
# Outside Woodpecker (517: `just nightly-publish` on the nightly host, which
# runs this script only with LEVICULUM_PUBLISH_FORGE=1 since 726) the
# token comes from a file instead, read only when CODEBERG_TOKEN is unset:
#   LEVICULUM_CODEBERG_TOKEN_FILE  default ~/.config/codeberg-token
# It is never printed.
#
#   LEVICULUM_PUBLISH_DRY_RUN=1  runs the nightly gate and lists what would be
#                                uploaded, then stops before the first forge
#                                request: no release change, no tag push.
#
# The compiler that produced the assets is read from .rustc-version, the
# stamp scripts/deb-stamp.sh leaves in the repo root; this step's image has
# no rustc to ask.

# purpose (#300; the other two and their reasons are in

Current build: \`${BUILD_ID}\` (commit \`${CI_COMMIT_SHA}\`, built with \`${RUSTC_VERSION}\`)

Rolling nightly build. The assets under this release are **replaced on every CI run** — this tag always points at the latest nightly.

**Debian / Ubuntu packages** (statically linked musl, runs on Debian 9+ / Ubuntu 16.04+, no extra packages needed):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-amd64.deb
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-arm64.deb
\`\`\`

\`sudo apt install ./leviculum-nightly-amd64.deb\` installs \`lnsd\` as a systemd service and sets up \`/etc/reticulum\` for Python-RNS client drop-in compatibility.

\`leviculum-nightly-arm64-heapacct.deb\` is an instrumented build for memory censuses, not for daily use: its \`lnsd\` counts every allocation, and it replaces the plain package on install and is replaced by it again.

**Userspace tarball** (just the binaries plus README/LICENSE/CHANGELOG, no service, no root needed):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-amd64.tar.gz
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-arm64.tar.gz
\`\`\`

\`tar xzf leviculum-nightly-amd64.tar.gz && ./leviculum-nightly-amd64/bin/lnsd --version\` runs without installing anything system-wide.

**lnomad — Nomadnet terminal browser** (separate package, does not install or start the lnsd service):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lnomad-nightly-amd64.deb
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lnomad-nightly-arm64.deb
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lnomad-nightly-amd64.tar.gz
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lnomad-nightly-arm64.tar.gz
\`\`\`

\`sudo apt install ./lnomad-nightly-amd64.deb\` — the browser needs a running RNS instance (leviculum's \`lnsd\` or Python \`rnsd\`).

**lblogd — dev-blog server** (separate package; serves Markdown posts as a NomadNet page node and on the clearnet):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lblogd-nightly-amd64.deb
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lblogd-nightly-arm64.deb
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lblogd-nightly-amd64.tar.gz
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lblogd-nightly-arm64.tar.gz
\`\`\`

\`sudo apt install ./lblogd-nightly-amd64.deb\` installs and starts \`lblogd\` as a systemd service. As shipped it serves on \`http://127.0.0.1:8180/\`; \`/etc/lblogd/config.toml\` explains how to put it on a public domain with automatic HTTPS.

\`lnomad\` and \`lblogd\` carry their own version numbers, independent of the \`leviculum\` packages above.

**lnflash — firmware flasher for LNode boards** (self-contained bundle: the flasher, one prebuilt firmware image per supported board, and Nordic's S140 SoftDevice with its licence for the board that can need it):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/lnflash-nightly-amd64.tar.gz
\`\`\`

This is the prebuilt embedded firmware — no checkout, no Rust toolchain, no build. One image per board:

| board | hardware |
| --- | --- |
| \`t114\` | Heltec Mesh Node T114 |
| \`rak4631\` | RAK4631 — the WisMesh Pocket V2 and the other carriers built around that module |
| \`t1000e\` | SenseCAP T1000-E (level \`expected\`: not yet run on our rig) |

\`tar xzf lnflash-nightly-amd64.tar.gz && cd lnflash-* && sudo ./lnflash\` — nothing is downloaded and nothing is installed; everything it writes to the board is in the directory. \`--dry-run\` says what is attached and changes nothing. The flasher binary is amd64; the firmware images and the SoftDevice inside are not architecture-specific.

Flash with this rather than by dragging a bare \`.uf2\` onto the bootloader drive: our images sit above an S140 7.x SoftDevice and a factory T114 ships 6.1.1, on which the image boots into nothing and the board goes dark until RESET is double-tapped. \`lnflash\` reads the installed version off the board before writing — it repairs a T114 and refuses a board it carries no remedy for.

**Source tarball** (tracked files at the same commit as the .debs above, no submodules):

\`\`\`
https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-source.tar.gz
\`\`\`

Each asset is published with a matching \`.sha256\` next to it.

**Previous build.** Every asset above is also here once more with \`.previous\` before its extension, for instance \`https://codeberg.org/${CI_REPO}/releases/download/nightly/leviculum-nightly-amd64.previous.deb\` and its \`.previous.deb.sha256\`. That is the build this one replaced, exactly one build older, kept as a fallback should this one misbehave; the next run replaces it in turn. \`dpkg-deb -I leviculum-nightly-amd64.previous.deb\` shows its version, which ends in the date and commit it was built from.

Verify with \`lnsd --version\` after install.

# The release rolls, so the git tag must roll with it. Forgejo points the

# refreshing an existing release never moves the ref. That left `nightly`
# frozen at its creation commit (05a17675, 2026-05-06) while the assets
# beside it moved on nightly — the release page's "Source code" links
# served months-old source next to current binaries. Force-push the tag to
# the commit this run actually built, after the swap is complete so a failed
# upload or a surviving stale asset never moves it. The commit is already on
# the remote (CI builds pushed commits), so this transfers no objects, only
# the ref.
#
# The push authenticates through a one-shot credential helper, never a
# token-in-URL remote: when a push fails, git prints the full remote URL
# into the error message, and this log is public. The helper string is
# single-quoted on purpose — git expands the variable when it invokes
# the helper, reading the environment (exported above), so the token
# appears in no URL and in no process argument. The empty helper first
# clears any inherited helpers so ours is the only one consulted.
# Everything else in this script authenticates via header for the same
# no-token-in-URL reason.
