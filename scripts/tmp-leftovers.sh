#!/usr/bin/env bash
# `cargo test --workspace` leaves nothing behind in the temp directory (730).
#
# /tmp on the coder host is a tmpfs, so every scratch directory a test leaks
# is RAM, and the host runs the suite all day. On 2026-10-14 it held 40 201
# entries older than two days and stood at 100 %; the OOM killer took two
# passes beside a gate that week.
#
# Shape: run the suite in the ordinary way, but with TMPDIR pointed at a fresh
# directory of its own. `std::env::temp_dir()` and the `tempfile` crate both
# honour TMPDIR, and so do the daemons and Python peers a test spawns, so every
# scratch path the suite builds lands there and nothing else does. Whatever is
# still in it once `cargo test` has exited is a leak, attributed by name, and a
# concurrent gate on the same host cannot put anything in it. That is what
# makes the verdict deterministic where a before/after diff of /tmp itself is
# not: another lane's run creates and deletes entries there the whole time.
#
# The /tmp diff is still printed, as information: a test that hardcodes
# "/tmp" bypasses TMPDIR, and the diff is where such a path would show up.
# It is not part of the verdict for the reason above.
#
# The one path the suite keeps on purpose is the test port counter, and it lives
# outside TMPDIR: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, /run/user/<uid> or /tmp, keyed by uid
# (leviculum-std/tests/support/port_alloc.rs, state_dir; 778). No exclusion here.
#
# Exit 0 = the suite passed and left nothing in its TMPDIR.
# Exit 1 = it left entries (named), or the suite itself failed.

# The compiler cache's server must not be born inside $scratch (987). sccache
# runs as RUSTC_WRAPPER on the coder host, and its client starts the server on
# first use when none is running, as a child that inherits the client's
# environment. The server makes a temp dir per compile under temp_dir(), so a
# server started by this suite would live in $scratch, and once the trap below
# removes it every compile on the host fails with "sccache: Failed to create
# temp dir ... /tmp/tl.XXXXXX/sccache..." (exit 254) until the server idles out.
# 985 hit exactly that with a hand-rolled `TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d) cargo test`.
# sccache 0.10 has no variable that places the server's temp dir (SCCACHE_DIR
# is the cache, not the scratch), so the server is started here, before TMPDIR
# changes, under the host's own environment. A server already running answers
# "Address in use" and is kept, which is the case this wants. If it idles out
# mid-suite (SCCACHE_IDLE_TIMEOUT, 600 s by default) a later compile could still
# restart it in $scratch; cargo compiles every target before running any, so
# that would take a test that itself spawns a build after ten idle minutes.
