# Fixture test for scripts/lnflash-bundle.sh: which build a bundle says it is.
#
# PUB-0022: every nightly bundle was named after the bare Cargo version, so
# two nightlies of one development window were the same "lnflash-0.10.0-dev"
# on disk, the same UF2 names and the same manifest version, and the person
# holding one could not say which firmware they had flashed. The bundle now
# carries the leviculum .deb's own stamp, <version>~nightly.<UTCdate>.<sha7>,
# in three places: the tarball name (and the directory inside it), every UF2
# name together with the manifest that points at them, and the README. This
# runs the real script from a known commit and asserts all three.
#
# The script builds two firmware images and a musl binary; none of that is
# what is under test, so a PATH of stubs stands in for the toolchain: cargo
# answers `metadata` and writes placeholder artefacts for `build`, rustc
# names a compiler and writes a copying bin2uf2, llvm-objcopy copies, and the
# lnflash it "builds" accepts --check-bundle. ~1 s, no network, no build.
#
# #438 added the NRF_FEATURES knob (`just lnflash-bundle nrf_features=...`) for
# a rig A/B arm. Without it a bundle must stay what it was, so every default
# case also asserts the manifest carries no `features` key and every firmware
# build got its board's bsp-* set and nothing more; the features case asserts
# the `+<feature>` suffix, the manifest list and the extra build features.
#
# LNFLASH_BUNDLE_SH overrides the script under test, which is how the
# pre-fix version is checked to be red:
#   LNFLASH_BUNDLE_SH=<old copy> bash scripts/test-lnflash-bundle.sh
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test-lnflash-bundle.sh
