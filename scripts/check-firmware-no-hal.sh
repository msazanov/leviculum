# The orchestration stratum links no HAL (Codeberg #469, gate
# `firmware-no-hal` of docs/src/concepts/firmware-layers.md, "Gates the new
# stratum brings").
#
# `leviculum-firmware` is the one copy of the node loop every chip family
# binds to, so a HAL or a radio stack in its graph is a chip in stratum 2,
# whichever module pulled it. The subject is cargo's resolved graph rather
# than the manifest text, so a HAL that arrives through some intermediate
# crate is caught too; the precedent is scripts/check-nrf-evt-max-size.sh.
# `--target all` and dev edges included: a HAL behind a target table or in a
# test-only dependency is still a chip the crate was built against.
#
# Positive control first, on a temp copy of the workspace sources (git
# ls-files of the firmware workspace and its path dependencies, ~14 MB): the
# unmodified copy must pass, and the copy with `embassy-nrf` injected as a
# dev-dependency must be refused naming it.
#
# Usage: check-firmware-no-hal.sh
