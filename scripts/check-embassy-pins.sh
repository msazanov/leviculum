#
# The embassy pin rule for the firmware workspace (Codeberg #469, step 0 of
# docs/src/concepts/firmware-layers.md). Rule and pin table:
# docs/src/firmware/embassy-pins.md.
#
# One version set per workspace: every manifest under leviculum-nrf/ (and the
# LR11xx driver, which the firmware pulls by path from its own workspace) that
# names an `embassy-*` crate names it at one semver-compatible version, and
# never from a git source. Nor may any `[patch.*]` table carry a git
# revision. Two versions of one embassy crate build two executors or two
# time drivers that do not see each other; a git revision in master is a
# build nobody can reproduce once the branch moves.
#
# Reads the manifest TEXT (tomllib), not cargo's resolution: the subject is
# what a member declares, so the guard needs no network and no lock, and it
# names the file that broke the rule. A transitive copy a dependency brings
# (nrf-softdevice's own embassy-sync 0.6) is that dependency's pin, not ours.
#
# Self-tests first, on a temp copy of the real manifests: an injected second
# version and an injected git patch must each be refused, or the guard fails.
#
# Usage: check-embassy-pins.sh [ROOT]   (ROOT defaults to the repo root)
