# Fixture test for the nightly publish step (Codeberg #286).
#
# Every case runs the REAL scripts/publish-nightly.sh against a fake `curl`
# and a fake `git` on PATH, with a fixture release whose asset list lives in
# a file. Nothing here mocks the script's own logic: the injected failure is
# an HTTP status from the forge, and the assertion is on what the release
# holds afterwards and whether the run said so.
#
# The two defects this was written for, both reproduced against master
# 0a953f0c before the fix:
#
#   1. AN UPLOAD THAT FAILS IS NOT NOTICED. The upload curl had no `-f`, no
#      status capture and its output went to /dev/null, so an HTTP 500 left
#      the loop running, the run exited 0 and the log ended in `[publish]
#      done` with a link to the release. Case `upload-fails` injects that
#      500 and asserts a non-zero exit.
#
#   2. THE ASSETS WERE DELETED BEFORE THE NEW ONES EXISTED. A failed upload
#      therefore left the release EMPTY, and the README's hardcoded download
#      URLs 404 until the next successful nightly. The same case asserts the
#      previous assets are all still there afterwards, and `happy-path`
#      asserts the order they are now published in: every upload before any
#      delete.
#
# Codeberg #270 added a third: A DELETE THAT ANSWERED 504 WAS CALLED A FAILED
# SWAP. Pipeline 471 was failed by two gateway timeouts out of 36 deletions
# whose assets the forge had in fact removed. The judgement now comes from a
# read-back of the release, and a 5xx is retried; the three `delete-504-*` and
# `delete-403-*` cases below fix both halves of that — green when the retry
# gets through, red when the duplicate is really there.
#
# PUBLISH_SH overrides the script under test, which is how the pre-fix
# version is checked to be red: `PUBLISH_SH=<old copy> bash
# scripts/test-publish-nightly.sh`.
#
# Codeberg #323 added a fourth: A GOOD BUILD WAS GONE THE MOMENT A BAD ONE
# REPLACED IT. The swap deleted every replaced asset, so a run that published a
# broken build left nothing to fall back to. The replaced set is now renamed to
# `<name>.previous.<ext>` before the uploads and kept; the set before that is
# what gets deleted. `happy-path` and `first-run-no-previous` assert the end
# state and the order, `upload-fails` and `rename-504-gives-up` that a failed
# run leaves every name where it was.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/test-publish-nightly.sh
