#!/usr/bin/env bash
# rig-cell.sh <cell> [cell...] — run single hardware cells on the bench with
# the discipline of the full tier-3 runner: the bench lock, the standing debug
# readers stopped for the run and brought back after it, the pinned periculum
# snapshot as executor, the rig worktree as the tree under test, and the
# airtime lock waived (the bench is a shielded room; a cell that is ABOUT duty
# is run by other means).
#
# It replaces a reviewer helper that lived in the bench directory and knew its
# host by literal paths and its boards by three literal serials. Here every
# host path comes from the environment with a default derived from $HOME, and
# the boards come from the bench's own rig.toml.
#
# Environment (default in brackets):

#   LEV_RIG_READER_WAIT       seconds to wait for a board's link after the run [30]
#
# THE READERS
#
# Every `firmware = "lnode"` device in rig.toml gets one reader on its if00
# debug port, found by serial alone (`usb-*_<serial>-if00`: the product part
# of the name differs per board, the serial does not). The reader is
# scripts/debug-witness-reader.py with --attach-now: it attaches at once,
# timestamps every line, and re-attaches across every reset. Its default mode
# waits for a vanish before attaching, which is right during a run and would
# record nothing between runs. Logs go to $LEV_RIG_RUN/readers/<board>.log.
#
# The cell resets every board it binds, so right after the run a board's link
# is often missing for a few seconds. readers_back waits for it, per board, and
# says either way; a board that is not back is named, never skipped silently.
