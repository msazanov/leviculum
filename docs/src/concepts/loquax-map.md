# loquax: the map

Part of the [loquax design record](loquax.md). Lew, 2026-10-27: the vector
map is part of loquax. Messenger and map belong together because telemetry
travels over the same LXMF channel as the messages, and the user wants to
see the positions inside the messenger. The map comes to the desktop
loquax, its terminal frontend and the planned iced GUI, not only to the
board. [A messenger whose core runs anywhere](handheld-messenger.md), "The
map", already calls the map a product of its own and a view inside the
messenger, on the desktop and embedded. This page plans it in slices.

**Status: decided 2026-10-27 (Lew), all five points of section 7 as
proposed.** Slice (a), positions in the model shown as text, is built
(2026-10-27, leviculum 1059, commit `230c5e4d`); slice (b), the map core
`leviculum-map`, the region tool `leviculum-map-tool`, the region file and
its size measurement, is built (2026-10-27, leviculum 1062); slice (c),
the terminal's map, is built (leviculum 1065); slice (d), the window's map,
is built (2026-10-28, leviculum 1084); slice (e), the M9's, is not. The measurement it rests on is
`docs/drafts/map-measurement-2026-10.md`; the decisions it rests on are the
toolkit ([A GUI toolkit for the desktop and the M9](gui-toolkit.md),
option B) and the vector path with our own filler (handheld-messenger.md,
"The map", 2026-10-25). Tracked under #232 (the messenger core) and #474
(the map).

## What loquax receives of telemetry today

Since slice (a), every position. The engine passes an incoming message's
fields on (`Message::fields`, `leviculum-lxmf/src/message.rs:84`):
`RouterEvent::MessageReceived` becomes `OutboxEvent::Received` with the
fields beside id, source, title, body and the verification
(`loquax/src/engine.rs:459`, `loquax/src/outbox.rs:215`). The core reads
the two telemetry fields into positions (`telemetry::read`,
`loquax/src/telemetry.rs:130`), the screen model keeps each peer's latest
and hands every one to the store (`take_telemetry`,
`loquax/src/ui.rs:2892`), and the store keeps the fields whole in its
`fields` column (`loquax/src/store.rs:1841`) and the positions in a table of
their own (`SCHEMA_V2`, `loquax/src/store.rs:173`). The sender's timestamp
is still not carried: `OutboxEvent`, the screen's `Message` and every type
the model folds derive `Eq`, which an `f64` cannot, so carrying it is a
change of its own and not the one line of plumbing the fields were.

Before slice (a) the fields were dropped at that hand-over, and a telemetry
report, whose body and title are empty ([Telemetry](telemetry.md), "A
reporting message carries no text"), arrived as an empty block in the
peer's conversation with its position lost.

What the core reads them with, all in `leviculum-lxmf`, `no_std + alloc`:

- the field numbers, `FIELD_TELEMETRY` and `FIELD_TELEMETRY_STREAM`
  (`leviculum-lxmf/src/constants.rs:61`, `leviculum-lxmf/src/constants.rs:62`);
- the Telemeter codec, `Telemetry` (`leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:176`)
  with `Telemetry::decode_field_value`
  (`leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:325`), and its `Location` in the wire's
  scaled integers (`leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:56`);
- the stream decoder for a collector's rows, `decode_stream_field_value`
  (`leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:381`);
- the request reader, `telemetry_request_timebase`
  (`leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:688`), whose command id is a
  documented assumption (`COMMAND_TELEMETRY_REQUEST`,
  `leviculum-lxmf/src/telemetry.rs:678`).

## 1. What the user sees

**In the conversation.** A peer with a known position carries it in the
header, at 120 columns on the header's second row beside how the peer is
reached: `at 43.77310 N 11.25600 E · ±5 m · 4 min ago`. At 80 columns the
header shows only the age, `pos 4 min`, so the reader knows there is one.
`Enter` on a report's line, or a click on it, opens the map at that
report's fix with the sender's pin selected, and a click on the header's
position, `L` or `Alt-l` puts the peer on the map at its latest fix
(1076). The detail view (`v` on any message, `Enter` on one that is not
a report, slice 2 of [keys, mouse and
layout](loquax-keys-and-layout.md)) of a telemetry message lists every
sensor the codec decoded: position with altitude, speed, bearing and
accuracy where given, the fix time, battery, link and temperature. A
telemetry message is not drawn as an empty block. It is one line in the
conversation, `◎ position 43.77310 N 11.25600 E, 14:05`, so the exchange
still shows when a report arrived, and the rows of one peer's reports
fold into the latest one when they follow each other. As built, the `14:05` is the
block's own arrival time beside the line, as every block carries it; the
fix's own time is in the header's age and the detail view. A run folds
only within one day, and not across a name note or the `new` rule.

**The age** is always shown and always counts from the fix time
(`Location::last_update`), not from when the message arrived: a report
that waited at a propagation node for an hour is an hour old. Accuracy is
shown only when the sender gave one; nothing is invented for a missing
field, the same rule as the producer's ([Telemetry](telemetry.md), "No
fix, no position").

**The map view** is a palette action, `map`, with a key the keymap table
of [keys, mouse and layout](loquax-keys-and-layout.md) assigns. It
takes the conversation pane, so the list stays and `Esc` returns. It shows
every peer with a position, our own if we have one, a pin per peer with
its name by the display rule of [the mailbox page](loquax-mailbox.md)
(petname, else announced name, always with the short hash; slice 5), and
the age beside each name. A stale fix (below) is drawn dimmed with its age.
Selecting a pin, by `Tab` through the pins or by click, opens that peer's
conversation. The view fits all pins on open; `+`, `-` and the arrows zoom
and pan, `0` fits again. A fit goes no deeper than the region under its
centre has data for (its max zoom, the outline's z10 where no region is),
so one pin is not shown as a few metres of plain colour; `+` goes on into
the overzoom.

## 2. The data path

**In.** Two fields carry positions, both read with the codec above:

- `FIELD_TELEMETRY` (0x02), one node's own readings, whose source is the
  message's signed source.
- `FIELD_TELEMETRY_STREAM` (0x03), a collector's rows, each
  `[source_hash, timestamp, packed_telemetry, appearance]` ([Telemetry](telemetry.md),
  "The collector exchange"). Here the row's source is who measured, and
  the message's source only who delivered.

The format is Sideband's, its `Telemeter` class in `sense.py`, with
`Location.pack` as the position's layout and `Telemeter.from_packed` as
the reader that skips a sensor it does not know (Sideband `2000d81`, cited
by symbol for the reason [Telemetry](telemetry.md) gives). Columba's
`TelemeterCodec.kt` reads and writes the same two sensors, time and
location (Columba `0930293`). So a position from Sideband or Columba, and
from one of our boards, is the same bytes, and loquax reads all three with
one decoder. A SID mapped to nil is a sensor without a reading, accepted.

**The cut.** The engine passes `message.fields` on in
`OutboxEvent::Received`; the core (not the frontend) decodes the
telemetry fields and turns each reading with a location into a position
event. A blob that does not decode is kept raw and named in `tui.log`,
never dropped silently, the archive rule of `lntd` ([Telemetry](telemetry.md),
"What a receiving node owes").

**Stored where.** Slice 6's SQLite store fills its `fields` column with
the raw msgpack and gains one table, through the schema version
(`SCHEMA_VERSION` 1 to 2, a migration that only adds):

```sql
CREATE TABLE positions(
    identity BLOB NOT NULL,      -- our own address, as on every table
    peer BLOB NOT NULL,          -- who measured
    via BLOB NOT NULL,           -- who delivered; differs for a stream row
    message INTEGER REFERENCES messages(seq) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    fix_time INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- Location.last_update, unix seconds
    received_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    lat_e6 INTEGER NOT NULL, lon_e6 INTEGER NOT NULL,
    alt_e2 INTEGER, speed_e2 INTEGER, bearing_e2 INTEGER, accuracy_e2 INTEGER,
    telemetry BLOB NOT NULL,     -- the raw Telemeter, for what we cannot decode yet
    PRIMARY KEY (identity, peer, fix_time));
```

The wire's integers are stored as they are, so no rounding happens between
the wire and the disk. As built, `received_at` may be NULL: a report
that arrives before the shell first told the screen the time has no
receive time to store, and inventing one would be the placeholder the
telemetry page forbids. A fix the wire gives no accuracy for (the field
is always packed, so zero is the only absence it can say) is stored as 0
and shown without one. The key `(peer, fix_time)` is Sideband's dedup rule
(exact source and timestamp), so the same fix arriving directly and again
in a collector's stream is one row. The map reads the latest row per peer;
the table keeps the track, which a later slice can draw. Retention follows
the messages: kept until the reader deletes them, with the conversation or
by a palette action `forget positions`.

**A future fix** is clamped for ordering, kept for display, the ingress
rule of [Time and clocks](time-and-clocks.md#ingress-clamp-for-semantics-keep-for-display):
a fix stamped ahead of our clock sorts at receive time and shows its claimed
time with a mark. Without the clamp, one wrong clock would pin a peer's
pin at "now" forever.

**Stale.** Decided 2026-10-27 (Lew): a fix is drawn as current up to 2 h old and dimmed
after that, with its age always beside it. Two hours is twice the station
profile's heartbeat (`max_interval_ms`, 60 min,
`leviculum-nrf/telemetry-policy/src/lib.rs:190`; the tracker's is 15 min,
`leviculum-nrf/telemetry-policy/src/lib.rs:175`), so a board that misses
one report stays current and one that misses two goes dim. A fix is never
removed for its age alone; it goes with a delete. This closes
handheld-messenger.md's open "how other nodes' positions age out of the
map".

**Asking a peer for its position** is a later step, not in slices (a) to
(e). The request is an LXMF message whose `FIELD_COMMANDS` carries
`TELEMETRY_REQUEST` with a timebase ([Telemetry](telemetry.md), "A request
from the target triggers one report"); sending one is a palette action
`request position` on the open conversation. Answering one needs a
position of our own and the user's per-peer switch of section 7, so it
waits for that.
Its command id must first be pinned against a captured Sideband request,
as the codec's own comment says.

## 3. The renderer split

One map core, three frontends. The core does what is the same problem on
every screen; a frontend only turns the core's output into its pixels or
cells and its input into the core's events, the rule of "The core/frontend
cut" on handheld-messenger.md.

| crate | what | `no_std` | used by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `leviculum-mapfill` (exists) | scanline filler, wide lines, the flat geometry reader, the render pipeline into any `DrawTarget`, and since 1062 a per-feature `Pass` that draws one feature at a placement, so several fixtures share one frame | yes, no `alloc` | the core, all three frontends |
| `leviculum-map` (built, 1062) | the region file reader, Web Mercator projection, the viewport (centre, zoom, pan, fit), tile selection and feature culling, the layer profile per zoom, the style tables (`leviculum-mapfill`'s, re-exported), pins and labels as data, the class-by-class draw of a view's tiles | yes, `alloc` | all three frontends |
| `leviculum-map-tool` (built, 1062, `std`) | cuts a region file from Protomaps PMTiles archives (section 4); prost and the tree's one MVT decoder live here, and `leviculum-mapfill/measure/` reads its tiles through it; no package ships it | no | the desktop, by hand |
| loquax core | positions in the model, the map view's state (open, viewport, selected pin), the events | yes, `alloc` | all three frontends |

The frontends:

- **The TUI** (`loquax`, ratatui). The core renders the view into an
  Rgb565 or Rgb888 frame through `leviculum-mapfill`, and the frontend
  hands that frame to the terminal: through `ratatui-image`'s graphics
  protocols where the terminal has one, else as Unicode half-blocks, else
  as a braille line drawing (the terminal options below). Pins and names
  are drawn as text cells over the picture, not into it, so they stay
  sharp and clickable on every backend.
- **The iced GUI.** The same frame, at the window's size, as an iced
  image widget; pins and labels as iced text over it. Panning by drag and
  zoom by wheel are input mapped to the same core events.
- **The M9.** The same pipeline straight into the panel's
  `embedded-graphics` target, as the measurement firmware does
  (`leviculum-mapfill/m9/`), with mousefood's cells for the labels.

One drawing path for all three is the point: the measured renderer is the
renderer, and a style change shows on every screen at once. The desktop
does not need a second, richer renderer to look acceptable; at desktop
sizes the pixel count grows (a 1280x800 view is 13 times the M9's), and
the host is fast enough for that by the measurement (1.25 ms for the full
240x320 view, Table "Host numbers").

## 4. Tiles

**Format.** One region file, read by all three frontends. It is a tile
pyramid of the flat i16 geometry that `leviculum-mapfill` already reads in
place (the `.lmf` fixture layout, one per tile) behind a directory index,
already cut to the per-zoom layer profile: z15 and z14 without
`buildings` and `pois`, the region zooms with `landuse` and `natural`
thinned and their geometry simplified ("Simplifications the numbers ask
for", items 1 and 2). Pre-decoded geometry is what the device measured
(177 ms full, 90 ms stripped, 31 ms flush); decoding MVT on the M9 was the
cost the measurement found to dominate, and the region file removes it.
The desktop could read MVT, but one format for all three is one thing to
test.

**Region file** (built, 1062; the reader is `leviculum-map/src/region.rs`,
whose module comment is the normative layout). All integers little-endian,
offsets from the start of the file:

- a header: `LMR1`, the version (1, or 2 since 1100 with names), the
  header length (64, or 96 for version 2), the bounds in
  degrees x 10^7 (west, south, east, north; west greater than east means
  across the antimeridian), the zoom range (at most 16, so x and y fit a
  `u16`), the layer profile id, where the attribution and the notice lie,
  the tile count, where the index lies and the file's length; version 2
  adds where the label index and the string table lie;
- the two texts, UTF-8 and both required: the attribution, one line every
  map view shows ("© OpenStreetMap contributors"), and the notice, the
  ODbL text, the derived-database sentence and the source the region was
  cut from (name, schema version, OSM replication time);
- one `.lmf` blob per tile, the fixture layout `leviculum-mapfill` reads,
  written for a 256 x 256 view with one tile at offset (0, 0) and the shift
  that takes its extent to 4,096 sub-pixels. Each feature's flags byte,
  a zero until 1099 and never read by a reader of that age, carries a
  line's bridge and tunnel and the class byte's newer half: forest on a
  park's byte, a secondary road on a major road's. An older reader draws
  those as the park and the major road it drew before, so the version
  stays 1 (`leviculum-mapfill/src/fixture.rs`);
- version 2 (LMR2, 1100): a label section per tile that has names, one
  string table for the whole region (UTF-8, u32 offsets, sorted, so a name
  is found by binary search), and a label index like the tile index right
  before it. A section holds point labels (kind, population rank, min
  zoom, flags, string, anchor: 12 bytes) and line labels that refer to a
  line feature of the tile's own blob (8 bytes), so a street name reuses
  the geometry the tile holds; and an alternate name per label where the
  name in the locale the cut was asked for differs from the local one.
  The layout is `leviculum-map/src/labels.rs`'s module comment. A version
  1 reader refuses version 2 with `RegionError::Version`; this reader
  reads both, and a frontend that draws no names never opens the label
  index or the table;
- the index last, 20 bytes per tile ascending by (z, x, y): z, x, y,
  offset, length. Last, so the cut can stream tiles and learn their count
  at the end.

**Names** (1100). The cut keeps the names of places (city, town, district,
village, suburb, neighbourhood; not localities, hamlets, isolated
dwellings or farms, which are 1,774 of the 1,933 places of a Frankfurt z13
tile), of water points and parks, each where its anchor lies in the tile
and the tile's zoom reaches its `min_zoom` (the deepest zoom keeps all, for
the views that overzoom it), and of named roads from z14, each a line
feature of its own. Street names show from z14 for major and secondary
roads, from z15 for the rest. Measured on the 4.x extracts with `--locale
de`: Frankfurt 9,878,095 to 10,270,116 bytes (+4.0 %), Berlin 35,176,663 to
36,309,038 (+3.2 %).

A tile with nothing left under the profile has no entry; a reader draws
the background there. Two entries may share a blob (the cut stores
identical tiles up to 4 KB once: 99,799 of Germany's 948,560 z15 tiles).
The reader never loads the file or the index: it opens through a `Storage`
(a slice in flash or memory, a file, later a card), checks the header
against the length, and finds a tile by binary search over the index in
place, 20 bytes a probe, because Germany's index alone is 25 MB. Every
entry and every blob is checked when it is used, so a truncated or
corrupt file is an error, never a panic; `verify` walks the whole index
once for a file a frontend did not make.

**Layer profile 1** (`leviculum-map/src/profile.rs`): no buildings at any
zoom (points, `pois` among them, are not in the flat format at all); from
z13 the extent stays 4,096 and the Douglas-Peucker tolerance is half a
pixel; z12 and shallower, the region zooms, are quantised to an extent of
512, simplified at one pixel and lose the landuse, natural and landcover
areas under 16 square pixels. A part (an outer ring with its holes) the
device could not hold whole (4,096 vertices, 1,024 rings, the M9's
capacities) is simplified again at doubled tolerance up to four pixels,
long lines are cut into pieces, and parts are packed into as few features
as fit, so no feature is skipped as an overflow on the device.

**Projection.** The world coordinate is two `u32`, 2^32 units around the
world: 9.3 mm at the equator; at z15 a pixel is 512 units (4.78 m at the
equator) and a sub-pixel 32. Longitude to x is integer and exact; latitude
to y uses `f64` through `libm` (software on the M9's single-precision FPU),
once per pin and per viewport change, never per vertex, since the region
holds geometry already projected. Both round-trip to the same 10^-7 degree
step. x wraps, so the antimeridian is wrapping arithmetic.

**Where it comes from.** The cut lives in `leviculum-mapcut`, which
`leviculum-map-tool cut` and loquax's autoload both call (1089). It reads
Protomaps PMTiles archives (one, or the parts of one build downloaded
separately, from a file or by HTTP range requests, only the directories
and tiles of the box) for a bounding box and writes the region file; the output does not depend on the
thread count or on the order the archive lists its tiles, and the same
input gives the same bytes. A named region and an OSM PBF are later steps:
a PBF reader exists (`osmpbf`, MIT OR Apache-2.0), but a PBF holds raw
nodes, ways and relations, and turning them into tiles (assembling
multipolygons, the coastline, generalising per zoom) is what planetiler does
for Protomaps; it is not cheap, so the PMTiles path stays the one input. Attribution and licence travel inside the file: the data is
ODbL ("© OpenStreetMap contributors"), every frontend shows the line on
the map view, and the region file's notice is what the open licence item
of handheld-messenger.md asks for.

**How a user gets one, zero config.** The 90 % rule (Lew, 2026-10-25; zero
config, #471) says the map works without a step. Decided 2026-10-27
(Lew), point 2 revised by Lew on 2026-10-28 (leviculum 1089):

1. Without any region file, the map view still works: pins on the world
   outline (section 7, Natural Earth). Positions are useful at once.
2. **Map data loads by itself** and is shown at once, with no further
   step: when the user goes to a place (a position report, the peer's
   position, `L` or `Alt-l`, or the map opened with pins no region holds),
   loquax loads the region around it; a key (`d`) and the palette's `load
   map area` load the visible area. It can be switched off in the config
   (`map_autoload = off`). The first version of this point (2026-10-27)
   said nothing downloads without an explicit action; Lew revised it
   because a map that stays empty until the user learns a command fails
   the 90 % rule, and a user who wants no download has the switch.
3. The Debian package ships no region; a board's flash image may carry
   one cut for its deployment.

**The autoload** (1089), `loquax::mapload` over `leviculum-mapcut`:

- *Source.* A PMTiles archive read by HTTP range requests, so only the
  tiles of the box and the directories above them are fetched, never the
  planet. Default: the newest Protomaps daily build that answers
  (`https://build.protomaps.com/<yyyymmdd>.pmtiles`, looked for back ten
  days, found once a session). `map_source = <url>` in loquax's config
  names another, for instance the project's own server later. Terms of
  the default, as Protomaps' download page (`docs.protomaps.com/basemaps/
  downloads`, read 2026-10-28) states them: the basemap is an ODbL
  Produced Work, OpenStreetMap attribution required, which the region
  carries in its attribution and notice; the bucket keeps the builds of
  the past week; and "URLs may change and hotlinking to these downloads
  are discouraged", the page advising a copy on one's own storage. The
  page sets no usage limits and says nothing of range requests from apps.
  So the default works and is honest about its source, but a fleet of
  messengers on it is the hotlinking the page discourages: a copy on the
  project's server, set as the default `map_source`, is the follow-up.
- *Around a place:* a box 6 km to each side (12 by 12 km), z10 to z15; a
  place counts as held when a region holds 3 km around it at z15. Measured
  2026-10-28 from the build of that day, cut on the coder host over its
  link: central Frankfurt 11.1 MB fetched, 3.87 MB region, 384 tiles, 8.3
  s; central Berlin 20.1 MB, 7.90 MB, 412 tiles, 11.7 s; the Vogelsberg
  countryside 2.5 MB, 1.26 MB, 360 tiles, 8.4 s. At most four places per
  opening of the map, one per group of pins a few streets apart.
- *The visible area:* the view's box, from three zooms above the view's to
  z15. Before anything is fetched the box's tiles are located from the
  directories and their bytes summed; over 64 MB of archive the deepest
  zoom is lowered, down to the view's own, and an area too large even
  there is refused with "zoom in" instead of a question. An area a region
  holds at the view's zoom loads nothing.
- *Showing it.* The region is written beside the others under a name no
  painter reads, checked whole, renamed into the maps directory, and the
  directory's epoch bumped; each painter reads the directory again before
  its next paint. Every region that reaches into a view is drawn, each
  into its own box (1077's clip), the deepest last, so loaded patches
  join up (this replaces "one region or the outline" of section 7). A
  place's map is fitted again to the region when it lands, unless the
  reader moved it.
- *Quiet and robust.* One load at a time on a thread of its own; the map
  title says `loading map`; `tui.log` has `MAPLOAD start`, `done` and
  `failed` lines with the box, zooms, bytes and `elapsed_ms`; a failure is
  one toast; a failed box backs off 30 s doubling to an hour; no internet
  is said once until a load succeeds again.
- *Disk.* Loaded regions are named `auto-<box>-z<min>-<max>.lmr` and are a
  cache of `map_cache_mb` megabytes (500 by default, a hundred or more city
  places), the least recently viewed evicted first, viewed meaning drawn,
  marked on the file's modification time at most once a minute. A file
  under any other name was placed by hand and is never evicted nor
  counted.
- *Privacy.* The source learns which areas are looked at, as any map
  server does. `map_autoload = off` stops the loads that start by
  themselves; `map_source` points them at a server the user trusts.

**Size per region**, measured 2026-10-27 (leviculum 1062) for layer profile
1, z0 to z15, from the Protomaps daily build of 2026-10-26 (Basemap 4.15.2,
OSM of 2026-10-26), cut on the coder host (10 vCPUs) with all threads. Each
region is a bounding box, so it holds more than the place: Frankfurt's box
is about 576 km² (the city 248), Hessen's about 44,000 (the state 21,100),
Germany's about 554,000 (the country 357,600). Germany's box was fetched
as three latitude bands of one build and cut as one source. Bytes include
each zoom's share of the index.

What it says for the default zoom range: the region is a third (the city)
to a half (the state, the country) of the PMTiles archive it was cut from,
and z14 and z15 are two thirds of it.
Without z15 Germany's box is 2.34 GB, without z14 too 1.21 GB; a Bundesland
to z15 is 0.4 GB, a city 10 MB. So a city or a state fits the M9's card at
every zoom, and a whole country fits a card but not the 16 MB NOR, where
only a city-sized cut does. A view never reads more than its four to six
tiles, so the file's size costs disk, not drawing time. The z15 tiles of
these cuts are smaller per tile than the measurement's Florence centre
(1.6 KB a tile in Germany's box against 13 KB in Florence), because most
of a country is fields and forest.

Earlier, unchanged: the Protomaps sample of Florence centre (about 5 x 5
km, z0 to z15, all layers, gzip MVT) is 6,601,156 bytes, and cut under
profile 1 it is 1,724,066; one z15 view of it, decoded to flat geometry
without points, is 278,236 bytes for four tiles.

## 5. Slices

In order. Each has its acceptance; where it touches a real exchange, a
phase in the 1001 cell (periculum's `regression/loquax_tui_chat_session.toml`,
`loquax` against the stock Python LXMF client `lxmf_node.py` on one
`lnsd`).

**(a) Positions in the model, shown as text.** The engine passes the
fields; the core decodes telemetry and stream fields into positions; the
store gains `positions` and fills `fields`; the header and the detail
view show position and age; a telemetry message is one `◎ position` line
instead of an empty block. Depends on slice 6 (history, built).
*Acceptance:* unit tests over the decode with fixtures of each producer
(a board report, Columba's location layout, a Sideband blob with a nil
sensor, a stream row, an undecodable blob kept raw); the store's migration
from version 1 with the durability tests; a `tui_snapshot` of the header
at 80 and 120 columns with a position. *1001 phase:* Bob sends a
`FIELD_TELEMETRY` message with a position and an empty body; Alice's
header shows it within 5 s with its age, and her conversation has one
position line and no empty block. The Python helper has no verb that sends
telemetry today (`lxmf_node.py` has `send` and `send_propagated`), so the
phase needs a `send_telemetry` twin of `lxmf-node`'s verb, packing a
`Telemeter` blob the way `Location.pack` does: a periculum companion order.

**(b) The map core and the region tool.** Built 2026-10-27 (leviculum
1062): the region file and the size table of section 4; the committed
fixture region `leviculum-map/fixtures/firenze.lmr`, pinned at z15, z13 and
z11 by `leviculum-map/tests/region.rs`; the deterministic cut by
`leviculum-map-tool/tests/cut.rs`; `just map-core-no-std` in `guards`.
`leviculum-map` and
`leviculum-map-tool`, the region format, the size measurement of section 4,
a region of the test area committed as a small fixture. Depends on nothing
open; it can run beside (a). *Acceptance:* the cut is deterministic (same
input, byte-identical file, as `extract` is today); a host render of the
fixture region at three zooms matches pinned counts, as
`leviculum-mapfill/tests/fixture.rs` pins the fixture's; projection and
culling unit tests (antimeridian, a pin at the view's edge); a
cross-compile gate that holds `leviculum-map` to `no_std`, as `just
loquax-core-no-std` holds the core. *1001
phase:* none, no exchange.

**(c) The TUI map view.** Built 2026-10-27 (leviculum 1065): the palette's
`map`, `M` in the list and the conversation and `Alt-m` everywhere; the
pins by the display rule with their ages, the selected one `◉`, a name set
left of its marker at the picture's right edge; fit on open and with `0`,
`+`/`-` and the arrows or `h` `j` `k` `l`, `Tab` through the pins by name,
`Enter` or a click to open the peer's conversation, `Esc` back; the ladder
kitty or sixel, half-blocks, braille, forced with `--graphics` and named
in `tui.log` as `GRAPHICS backend=`; the attribution line under the
picture. Since 1075 a key pans an eighth of the view, `H` `J` `K` `L` and
Shift with an arrow a half, and the picture is painted and encoded on a
thread of its own while the loop reads keys: the keys that queued behind
a frame are applied together, and the newest view wins (section 6,
Sixel). Pinned by `loquax/tests/tui_snapshot.rs`
(`the_map_shows_the_pins_on_the_region_and_the_outline_in_braille_and_halfblocks`,
frames in `loquax/tests/fixtures/tui_map.frames`), the model's tests in
`loquax/src/ui.rs`, the ladder and the protocol bytes in
`loquax/src/tui/map.rs`, and the core's in `leviculum-map/tests/view.rs`.
The core gained per-zoom line widths, a lines-only ink, the world outline,
region choice and the zoom range for it. Left for later: label collisions
between pins (the later-drawn name covers the earlier), and how text over a
sixel picture looks in foot, which no test here can see.
As planned: the `map` action, the pins with names and ages,
fit, zoom and pan, the three drawing backends, the attribution line.
Depends on (a) for positions and (b) for the core. *Acceptance:* a
`tui_snapshot` of the map view in the half-block and braille backends
(graphics protocols cannot be snapshotted as cells; their choice is a unit
test over the backend ladder, as `choose_backend` has today); pins
positioned by projection tests; clicking a pin opens the conversation.
*1001 phase:* after (a)'s phase, Alice opens the map and her frame shows
Bob's pin with his announced name.

**(d) The iced GUI map.** Built 2026-10-28 (leviculum 1084), Lew's
decision that day to start it: `loquax gui`, behind loquax's `gui` feature,
which no other feature enables, so the CLI, the terminal and the core carry
no iced. The window starts the same shell as the terminal (`loquax/src/
shell.rs`, moved out of `tui.rs`: the engine, the history, the sends and
fetches, the mailbox's schedule, the model) and shows the map: the peers
with a position on the left by the display rule with their fix's age, the
stale ones dimmed; on the right the region from the same maps directory,
the outline where none covers the view, the pins with their labels as iced
text, the credit always in the bar below. Drag pans, the wheel zooms about
the pointer, `+` `-` `0` as in the terminal, a click on a pin or a row
selects it; integer zooms only. The window counts in the screen's own
pixels and runs the model's map functions with one pixel a cell; a dense
screen draws its own pixels with the lines widened by its scale
(`Look::scaled`). The picture is `loquax::picture`, which the terminal
draws through too, and the label rule moved into the core as
`leviculum_map::pins::labels`, in cells for the terminal and in pixels
with the window's font measuring each label. Pinned by
`the_map_frame_over_the_fixture_at_three_zooms` in
`loquax/src/gui/map.rs` (the window's own pipeline, no display needed),
the label rule's tests in `leviculum-map/tests/labels.rs`, and `just
loquax-gui`. The binary is built for the gnu target: winit opens X11 and
Wayland with dlopen, which a musl-static binary cannot. Left for later:
conversations and compose in the window, the package. *1001 phase:* the
same as (c) once the cell can drive the GUI; until then none.

**(e) The M9 map.** The view on the panel with the region on flash.
Depends on (b), the M9's stage two (its keyboard UI, [The ThinkNode
M9](thinknode-m9.md)) and the M9 frontend of the messenger core.
*Acceptance:* the rig measurement repeated with the region file in place of
the fixture, frame and flush time against the device rows of the draft;
the orientation (MADCTL) settled. *1001 phase:* none; its exchange is a
hardware cell.

**Parallel.** (a) and (b) are independent and can run on two lanes at
once. (c) needs both. (d) and (e) need (b) and their own frontends, and
neither waits for the other.

## 6. The terminal's graphics

What the TUI can draw a map with, in the order the backend ladder tries.

**The kitty graphics protocol.** An APC escape that sends pixel data
(PNG or raw RGB) and places it on a cell rectangle; it can keep an image on
the terminal and only move it, which suits a map that redraws on a pan.
Spoken by kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty and Konsole by their own documentation,
not checked here. The crate is
`ratatui-image` 11.0.6 (MIT), already in the tree behind
`leviculum-ui-ratatui`'s `images` feature
(`leviculum-ui-ratatui/Cargo.toml:34`), built without its default
`chafa-dyn` so no C library comes in; `lnomad` draws pictures through it.
Its terminal query (`Pictures::detect`,
`leviculum-ui-ratatui/src/images.rs:113`) picks the protocol at start and
falls back to half-blocks.

**Sixel.** The DEC bitmap format, palette-based (so a map's flat colours
fit it well), redrawn whole on every change. Spoken by foot, xterm (with
`-ti vt340` or its resource), mlterm, WezTerm and Konsole by their own
documentation; only foot is checked here. `ratatui-image` encodes it through `icy_sixel` 0.5.0
(MIT OR Apache-2.0), pure Rust. Checked on the coder host: foot 1.21.0's
`foot.ini(5)` has `sixel` default `yes`, its `foot-ctlseqs(7)` lists the
kitty keyboard flags (query, push, pop, set) and no kitty graphics escape.
So a terminal that speaks the kitty keyboard protocol need not speak kitty
graphics: foot speaks the one and not the other, and draws the map by
sixel.

`ratatui-image` hands every sixel to `icy_sixel`'s Wu quantiser with
Floyd-Steinberg dithering at its defaults, and offers no setting for
either. A map frame has eight or nine colours, so that was most of a
frame's cost and bought nothing: measured 2026-10-27 (1075) on a 1395 x
1235 pixel pane over Frankfurt, the encode took 43 to 52 ms of a 49 to 71
ms frame. The painter now writes a sixel of the frame's own colours
itself (`leviculum_ui_ratatui::images::sixel_indexed`, `ratatui-image`'s
path stays for tmux and past 256 colours): 1.4 to 4.2 ms, frames of 6 to
22 ms, and at z14 304 KB to the terminal instead of 473 KB, each band
painting its commonest colour as one run. No visual cost: the colours are
the style's, not a quantiser's. Zoom stays in whole steps: a fractional
zoom would scale every tile by a non-power of two, which the viewport,
the tile selection and the draw transform of `leviculum-map` do not
carry today, a change to the core of all three frontends rather than to
the terminal. Lew's terminal is foot (the reviewer checked on his machine,
2026-10-27), which is why the ladder must not assume kitty graphics. The
`KEYS` line in `tui.log` names the keyboard, and slice (c) adds a
`GRAPHICS backend=` line beside it, so `tui.log` names the backend on
any machine.

**Half-blocks.** `▀` with a foreground and a background colour gives two
pixels per cell, in truecolor or 256 colours: the 80 x 24 layout's
conversation pane, about 52 x 20 cells, gives a map of about 52 x 40
pixels. Coarse, but filled areas and roads
are recognisable, and every modern terminal draws it. `ratatui-image`
already falls back to it.

**Braille dots.** `⣿` and its kin give 2 x 4 dots per cell in one
colour per cell: about 104 x 80 dots in the same pane, the sharpest line
drawing a terminal without graphics can do, but no filled areas and one
colour per cell. ratatui's own `Canvas` with `Marker::Braille` draws it
(ratatui 0.30.2, MIT, in the tree), and its `Map` shape is the world
outline of section 4. It is the backend for a terminal with neither
graphics nor 256 colours, and for `NO_COLOR`: roads and coastlines as
lines, pins as text.

The ladder, decided 2026-10-27 (Lew): kitty or sixel where the query finds one, else
half-blocks in colour, else braille. It is the ladder `lnomad`'s pictures
already climb, plus braille at the bottom.

Behind mosh it is braille (Lew, 2026-10-28, 1088). Measured on mosh
1.4.0 on the coder host: mosh answers the DA1 query itself, without
sixel, and drops a sixel DCS and a kitty APC whole, so no protocol
arrives; the half-blocks' `38;5`, `38;2` and `▀` pass unchanged. Lew's
map from Termux over mosh nonetheless showed an empty box in every cell
(`GRAPHICS backend=halfblocks detected=halfblocks`), a client-side
failure this host cannot see, so the ladder does not take half-blocks
there. mosh sets no variable; it is found as a `mosh-server` among the
parent processes (`leviculum_ui_ratatui::images::Between`). tmux and
screen are found too and named in `tui.log`, and change nothing: both
pass 256 colours, and `ratatui-image` wraps sixel for tmux. Inside tmux
a mosh session that holds the tmux client is not an ancestor and is not
seen. `GRAPHICS` names the rung and why: `reason=no-graphics,mosh`.

**The text techniques, and the ladder since 1093.** Lew, 2026-10-28:
loquax draws the most beautiful map the terminal can show, real graphics
where the terminal has them, then the best text techniques in order, and
a key cycles through every way live, the one the reader stays on
remembered. The techniques and the measurements behind their order are
`docs/drafts/terminal-map-rendering-2026-10.md` (1090). Built in 1093:

- The encoders are the map core's, `leviculum_map::cells`: one view
  drawn at 4 x 8 pixels a cell (one zoom deeper at twice the line width,
  so the view keeps braille's ground) and encoded into one glyph and two
  colours a cell. `octant` (U+1CD00, 2 x 4), `blocks` (quadrants and
  eighth blocks, the best fit a cell), `braille-thin` (one-dot lines in
  their colour over the areas' colours) and `mosaic` (one colour a cell)
  join half-blocks and plain braille. The octant fit runs on the eight
  2 x 2 sums in Gray code order and chooses exactly what the brute force
  over the 32 pixels chooses (a test holds it): 5.8 ms at 155 x 65 cells
  against 31 ms, release build on the coder host.
- The ladder: kitty or sixel where the terminal answers and neither mosh
  nor tmux sits between; octants where `TERM` or `TERM_PROGRAM` names a
  terminal that draws them itself (kitty, foot, WezTerm), and behind mosh
  only from a host whose glibc is 2.41 or later (an older mosh-server
  drops them); `blocks` at 256 colours or more without mosh and outside
  Termux; `braille-thin` otherwise, at 16 colours with each class in its
  own of the sixteen (`leviculum_mapfill::style::ansi16`); plain braille
  without colour. Half-blocks and the mosaic are no rung, only a choice.
  tmux now keeps the pictures off the top: it passes them only where its
  configuration allows.
- `t` and `T` (and `F2`) cycle every way in the ladder's order, the title
  naming the new one a moment; the palette's `map drawing` lists them
  with the current one marked. A way the facts say will not show is still
  offered, marked: the reader's eyes beat the detection. `g` shows the
  glyph test over the map, a line a glyph set and the ways that need it.
- The way the reader stays on is written to the config when they leave
  the map or quit, as `map_drawing.<context>`, the context
  `<mosh|tmux|screen|local>:<TERM_PROGRAM, else TERM>`. A remembered way
  wins over the ladder at the next start unless it cannot work there at
  all (a picture behind mosh), which is said once.

## 7. Decided

Lew, 2026-10-27, accepted the five proposals of this section as written.
Each alternative stays as one line, rejected, so the reasoning stays.

- **Decision 6: the vector path holds.** The device measurement says yes
  for the stripped profile: 90 ms to draw plus 31 ms to flush on the M9,
  177 ms plus 31 ms with buildings
  (`docs/drafts/map-measurement-2026-10.md`, "Device rows, measured
  2026-10-26"). The PNG raster fallback is dropped, and the region format
  of section 4 is the one format for the desktop and the board.
  *Rejected:* the PNG raster tiles of Meshtastic's layout, a second format
  to cut, ship and test that the measurement does not need.
- **TUI graphics: the ladder of section 6.** Kitty or sixel, then
  half-blocks, then braille. Lew's terminal is foot, which draws by sixel
  and speaks no kitty graphics, so the ladder must not assume kitty.
  *Rejected:* braille only, which needs no `ratatui-image` in loquax but
  gives no filled areas.
- **No default region in the package.** The world outline until a region
  is there (section 4). *Rejected:* a small default region in the
  package, which would have to be chosen for someone. This decision said
  "one explicit action to add one, no download of loquax's own" until Lew
  revised that half on 2026-10-28: map data loads by itself when the user
  goes to a place, switchable off (section 4, point 2, and "The autoload";
  leviculum 1089). The reason is the 90 % rule of #471: a map that stays
  the world outline until the user learns a command is a map most users
  never see. *Rejected with it:* the explicit `loquax map add` as the only
  way in.
- **Our own position is not sent by default.** loquax sends no position
  until the user switches it on per peer, and answers no telemetry
  request until then. A messenger that broadcasts where its user is
  because nobody changed a default is the failure this avoids; the cost
  is that two loquax users see each other on the map only after one step
  each. *Rejected:* sending by default.
- **Stale threshold 2 h** (section 2): dimmed after that, never removed
  for age alone. *Rejected:* removing a fix when it ages out.

The reviewer decided three more for slice (c), 2026-10-27 (leviculum 1065):

- **The world outline is Natural Earth**, public domain, the 1:50m land
  polygons of version 5.1.2, baked by `scripts/bake-world-outline.py`
  into `leviculum-map/data/ne_50m_land.lwo` (159,357 bytes, 1,422 rings,
  59,239 points, a step one pixel at zoom 10) and built into the binary;
  source and checksum in `leviculum-map/fixtures/README.md` and
  THIRD-PARTY.md. Drawn as land over water in colour and as coasts in
  braille, down to zoom 10. Since leviculum 1092 the country borders lie
  over it, Natural Earth's 1:50m land boundary lines of the same version
  (`ne_50m_admin_0_boundary_lines_land.lwl`, 49,512 bytes, 393 lines),
  thin lines in the style tables' border colour, dots in braille, down to
  zoom 10 as well; maritime boundaries are left out. Until leviculum 1073 it was the 1:110m
  polygons quantised to 611 m, 21,298 bytes, which looked coarse without
  a region; one table serves every zoom, a z2 view of a sixel pane
  rendering in under 6 ms.
  *Rejected:* the world file ratatui's `Map` shape draws, whose licence
  is unsettled.
- **`loquax map add` is not in slice (c).** Superseded by the autoload
  (1089), which uses the cut as a library (`leviculum-mapcut`) rather than
  spawning the tool. Regions placed by hand still work:
  loquax reads every `*.lmr` in `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/loquax/maps/`,
  or in `$LNMSG_HOME/maps/` when `LNMSG_HOME` is set. That variable
  replaces the whole default base for the identity and the store, so it
  replaces this one too, and a test or a second profile sees only its own
  maps. The man page says how to cut a region with
  `leviculum-map-tool cut`. Spawning the tool or a library feature is
  decided with `map add`.
- **One region or the outline, never a patchwork.** Superseded by 1089:
  loaded patches must join up, so a view now draws every region that
  reaches into it whose zooms reach the view's, each inside its box, the
  deepest last (`leviculum_map::choice::drawn`), over the outline. Until
  then: a view drew the
  installed region of the deepest max zoom whose box holds the view's
  centre and whose zooms reach the view's (its shallowest down to eight
  past its deepest), two alike by file name; the outline where none does.
  The zoom range offered is from the world down to the deepest a region
  draws at, and at least to zoom 10.
- **A region ends at its box.** The cut writes every tile that touches
  the box, so its data covers the box rounded out to each zoom's tile
  grid: at z8 Frankfurt's reaches 1.04 degrees east of the box, at z15
  none. Drawn whole, those tiles moved the region's edge as the reader
  zoomed. The core draws a region into its box alone (`Region::area`,
  `draw::draw_in`), so the edge is the same place on the earth at every
  zoom, within half a pixel, and the outline is drawn under the rest of
  the view (1077).
