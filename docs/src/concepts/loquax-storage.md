# loquax: conversation storage

Part of the [loquax design record](loquax.md).

The library stores one key (`ROUTER_STATE_KEY`, `b"lxmf/router-state"`,
`leviculum-lxmf/src/router.rs:65`) and hands each received message to the
application exactly once. **All history is the client's problem.**

## Options

**A. NomadNet's shape: a directory per conversation, a file per message.**
*For*: trivially crash-safe per message if each write is
temp-plus-rename; human-inspectable; deleting a conversation is `rm -rf`;
no dependency. *Against*: one inode per message forever; listing a
conversation is O(n) `listdir`; no search without reading everything;
NomadNet needed a `.index` sidecar that duplicates every message body on
disk (NomadNet's `Conversation.py`, lines 944-960) and still starves file
descriptors under announce storms (NomadNet commit `7bc6911`). On a
Raspberry Pi with an SD card this is the worst option.

**B. An append-only log per conversation plus a separate index.** Messages
appended as length-prefixed msgpack; an index mapping message ID to offset;
compaction on deletion. *For*: appends are one write and one fsync;
sequential reads are fast; the format is simple enough to recover by hand.
*Against*: you are writing a small database, including the index, the
compaction and the crash-consistency argument between them.

**C. SQLite.** One file, one `messages` table with the columns columba
already proved out. *For*: paging, search (FTS5), indices, transactions and
crash safety all solved by someone else; a 2 GB history is unremarkable;
`sqlite3` on the command line is the debugging tool. *Against*: `rusqlite`
with `bundled` compiles SQLite's C into the binary. `lnomad` treats a C
library in the path of the musl-static `.deb` as disqualifying
(`lnomad/Cargo.toml`, the `ratatui-image` comment), though that was about a
`pkg-config` probe for a *shared* library rather than a vendored static
one. **Checked empirically 2026-08-08**: `rusqlite` with `bundled` compiles
clean against `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` on the project toolchain —
statically linked binary, SQLite 3.46 embedded, FTS5 verified working by
query, 2.6 MB total, 25 s build. The `lnomad` disqualifier was a
`pkg-config` probe for a shared library and does not apply to the vendored
static build.

**D. A pure-Rust embedded store (`redb`, `sled`, `fjall`).** *For*: no C
toolchain, ACID, ordered keys, so range scans give paging for free.
*Against*: no query language and no full-text search, so search is
hand-rolled; another dependency to trust with the user's mail.

## Decision (2026-08-10)

**C — SQLite**, via `rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature. The packaging
question was answered by the build probe above, so the fallback to D is
retired. The schema below, with its three commitments (identity-scoped
rows, two timestamps sorted on `COALESCE(received_at, timestamp)`, raw
msgpack `fields`), is the starting point; attachments live out of line as
content-addressed files. Retention is settled further down.

The schema to start from, taking columba's two good decisions:

```
messages(
  id BLOB, identity BLOB, conversation BLOB,
  direction INT, state INT, method INT, verification INT,
  timestamp REAL,        -- the sender's clock, from the wire
  received_at REAL,      -- our clock, when we saw it
  title BLOB, content BLOB, fields BLOB,   -- fields as raw msgpack
  error TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id, identity))
```

with an index on `(conversation, identity, COALESCE(received_at, timestamp))`
and one on `(conversation, identity, direction, read)`.

Three reasons for the shape:

1. **Every row scoped by local identity.** A user may hold several
   addresses; columba's composite keys make that free, and retrofitting it
   later means a migration.
2. **Two timestamps, sort on `COALESCE(received_at, timestamp)`.** The wire
   timestamp is the sender's clock, and nothing makes another node's clock
   trustworthy. Sorting on it puts a peer with a wrong clock at the top or
   bottom of your history forever. NomadNet exposes this as a user-facing
   sort toggle, which is not a fix. (Sub-second precision is not the
   problem it once was on our side: the emission timestamp carries it, as
   the reference's `time.time()` does, because at whole-second granularity
   two identical messages created inside one second collapse to one ID —
   `leviculum-lxmf/src/router.rs:532-536`, Codeberg #217. Precision and
   skew are different failures, and only the second one is a sorting
   question.)
3. **`fields` stored as raw msgpack, not exploded into columns.** Unknown
   fields round-trip byte-for-byte in the library
   (`leviculum-lxmf/src/message.rs:5-8`) and must round-trip here too, or a
   reply to a message from a newer client loses information.

**Attachments out of line**, as NomadNet does (its `Conversation.py`, lines
752-812): content-addressed files under an `attachments/` directory, with
the row carrying names and hashes. Blobs in the database make the database
the size of the blobs, and a 2 MB voice message has no business in a row
you page through.

## Retention, decided 2026-08-10

Neither prior-art program prunes, and both will therefore eventually fail
on small hardware. The decision:

- **Message text is kept forever.** A million messages are a few hundred
  megabytes, SQLite territory, and the searchable archive is precisely the
  value the FTS decision bought.
- **Attachments live under a total-bytes budget** (default about 500 MB,
  configurable, numbers stated in the manual), evicting oldest first — the
  same pattern as `lnomad`'s byte-budgeted image cache
  (`lnomad/src/image_cache.rs:11-14`).
- **Evicting an attachment never touches the message row.** The message
  keeps the attachment's name, hash and size and renders "attachment
  (2.1 MB), evicted under the storage budget on <date>". The history does
  not lie, it just gets lighter.
- **Ledger rows** ([the delivery ledger](loquax-ui.md)) share the message's
  retention, so for text they live forever; no extra rule.
- A **per-conversation opt-in age cap** remains open as a possible later
  addition and was deliberately not built now.

## On the 2 GB Raspberry Pi question specifically

With option C, a 2 GB history is roughly ten million short messages, and
the operations that matter are "open the last screenful of a conversation"
and "search". Both are index lookups and neither touches the bulk. With
option A, opening a conversation reads every file in it. That asymmetry is
the whole argument.

## Durability rule, from `lnomad`'s counter-example

Nothing in this program may use `fs::write` on a file it cannot afford to
lose, and nothing may treat a corrupt load as an empty load
(`lnomad/src/bookmarks.rs:116-130`). Bookmarks can be silently forgotten.
Mail cannot.

## Built 2026-10-27 (leviculum 1049)

Option C as decided, in `loquax/src/store.rs` behind the `history` feature
(which `tui` turns on), at `${LNMSG_HOME}/history.sqlite3`: `rusqlite`
0.40 with `bundled`, the version `leviculum-cli` already links, so the
musl-static `.deb` gained no new crate and its third-party notices did not
change. The screen's side is `loquax/src/ui/history.rs`; slice 6 of
[keys, mouse and layout](loquax-keys-and-layout.md) says what the reader
sees, section 5, "Built 2026-10-27, history". Where the build fills a gap
this page leaves, or departs from it:

- **The key.** The schema above keys a message by `(id, identity)`. A
  message we write has no LXMF id until the router queues it, and a send
  that falls back to a mailbox is queued again under a second id, so the
  key is the screen's own message counter (`seq`, `Message::activity`),
  continued at start from the largest the store holds; `id` is a column,
  indexed. `identity` (our delivery address) scopes every row, as
  decided.
- **The columns kept empty.** `title`, `fields` and `timestamp` (the
  sender's clock) exist and stay NULL: the engine's `Received` event hands
  the screen neither the fields nor the wire timestamp, and the screen
  drops the title. Filling them is a change to the event, not to the
  schema. Until then nothing sorts on the sender's clock at all; the order
  is ours, `received_at` and the counter.
- **Three more tables.** `ledger`, a row a line of the delivery ledger,
  deleted with its message (the retention rule above); `conversations`,
  for the pin and the unread count; `names`, the names peers announced,
  so a peer is named after a restart. `message_text` is the FTS5 index,
  external content over `messages` kept by triggers, with the `trigram`
  tokenizer so a query matches a substring, as the screen's own matcher
  does. A query shorter than three characters scans with `LIKE`.
- **Writes.** The model notes what a fold changed, and the shell writes it
  in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction before the next event, rollback
  journal, `synchronous=FULL`, foreign keys on. A crash leaves the store as
  before the write or after it. The engine does no I/O under the core lock,
  so it does not write; this page's "the client's problem" is the screen's
  shell. A write that fails is said in a toast and after the screen, and
  logged as `LNMSG_STORE_FAILED`; the message stays on the screen.
- **The durability rule.** A missing file is a first start and is created
  with the schema. A file that is there is checked before anything reads
  it for the screen: SQLite reads its header and schema (and so refuses a
  file shorter than the page count its header gives, "database disk image
  is malformed", and one that is not SQLite at all), the schema version
  must be this program's (`PRAGMA user_version`, a later one is refused as
  newer, version 0 as not a loquax store, which covers an empty file), and
  all five tables must be there. Any of these stops `loquax` with the
  file's path and what to do (move it aside, or restore a backup); nothing
  is written over it. The tests cut a real store by its last page and by
  half after opening it whole as the positive control, and refuse an empty
  file, a text file and another program's SQLite file. A page damaged in
  the middle of an otherwise whole file is found when it is read, and is
  then an error, never an empty answer.
- **Paging.** The screen loads a conversation's newest 200 messages and
  asks for 200 more when the reader reaches the top: both index lookups on
  `(identity, conversation, seq)`, as "On the 2 GB Raspberry Pi question"
  argues.
- **One row per received message** (leviculum 1070). A message that came
  directly and comes again from the mailbox, the sender's fallback after
  a delivery it could not prove, shares its LXMF id with the first copy.
  The screen's own check sees only what it loaded, so after a restart the
  older copy is out of its sight; the shell asks the store
  (`Store::holds_received`, over the `id` index) before it folds a
  received message, and drops one the store holds. A write of a received
  message whose id another row already holds is a no-op as well. A
  message the reader deleted is no longer held and would come back.
- **Retention** is as decided: text and its ledger are kept until the
  reader deletes them (`d`, or the palette's `delete conversation`).
  Attachments do not exist yet, so neither does their byte budget.
- **Only the terminal writes.** `loquax send` and `loquax fetch` on the
  command line do not touch the store.
