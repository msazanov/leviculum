# lnsd(1)

## NAME

lnsd -- Reticulum network daemon

## SYNOPSIS

**lnsd** [**-c** *dir*] [**--storage** *dir*] [**-s**] [**--exampleconfig**] [**--writeconfig**] [**-v**...] [**-q**...]

## DESCRIPTION

**lnsd** runs the Reticulum network stack as a long-lived daemon process. It is a drop-in replacement for Python's **rnsd**: it loads the configs **rnsd** loads, serves the same shared instance IPC (Unix abstract sockets keyed by `instance_name`) with the same RPC handshake and key, including a configured `rpc_key`, and the Python client tools (**rnstatus**, **rnpath**, **rnprobe**, **rncp**) work against it unchanged.

The drop-in does not hold in one place, where the same config file gives a different daemon (docs/src/audits/2026-10-11-shared-instance-rpc.md, D12). A config that omits `share_instance` gets no shared instance under **lnsd** (default `false`, **rnsd** `true`); one that omits `enable_transport` gets transport under **lnsd** (default `true`, **rnsd** `false`); an interface section without `enabled` is live under **lnsd** and skipped by **rnsd**. Configs written by `lnsd --exampleconfig` set the three defaulted keys explicitly.

On startup, **lnsd** reads `config` from the configuration directory, opens all configured interfaces, and begins routing packets. When the directory holds no `config`, **lnsd** runs the configuration **rnsd** writes on its first start, held in memory and written nowhere: transport off, a shared instance named `default`, and one AutoInterface, `[[Default Interface]]`, in the default group. It logs which one it runs, `CONFIG source=file|default path=<file>`, and one `IFACE_CONFIG name= type= enabled= origin=configured|default` line per interface section. Before those it states which media it may start on its own, the `[auto]` section of the file (every medium off when the file has none) or the shipped defaults without a file: `AUTO_LAYER state=on|off reason=config|default|marker|env lan= servers= bluetooth= serial=`. `[auto] lan = yes` adds the AutoInterface of **rnsd**'s first-start file to a configuration that names none. It keeps running until it receives SIGINT or SIGTERM.

Sending SIGUSR1 prints a diagnostic dump of internal state to stderr.

## OPTIONS

**-c**, **--config** *dir*
:   Path to the Reticulum configuration directory, the way `rnsd --config` takes one. The config file is `<dir>/config`. Without this option the default lookup order applies; see FILES.

**--storage** *dir*
:   Storage directory path. Overrides the config file's `storage_path`, which in turn overrides the default `<config_dir>/storage`. It moves the daemon alone — the client tools read `storage_path` from the config — so a storage directory shared with `lnstatus`, `lncp`, `lnpath` or `lnprobe` belongs in the config file. Long-only on purpose: in `rnsd`, `-s` means `--service`, so the short letter stays reserved for that and the storage override is a Leviculum extension.

**-s**, **--service**
:   Declare that the daemon is running as a service, accepted for compatibility with `rnsd -s`. **lnsd** keeps logging to standard output, which journald captures; it does not redirect to a log file.

**--exampleconfig**
:   Print an example configuration to standard output and exit, like `rnsd --exampleconfig`. The output loads through **lnsd**'s own config loader.

**--writeconfig**
:   Write the configuration **lnsd** runs without a file to `<dir>/config` and exit, creating the directory if needed. The file is the one **rnsd** writes on its first start, byte for byte, followed by an `[auto]` section with the shipped defaults and a comment line per key, which **rnsd** ignores. An existing file is never replaced.

**-v**, **--verbose**
:   Increase log verbosity. Once for debug, twice for trace.

**-q**, **--quiet**
:   Decrease log verbosity. Once for warnings only, twice for errors only.

## ENVIRONMENT

**RUST_LOG**
:   Overrides the verbosity flags. See the `tracing-subscriber` documentation for filter syntax.

**LEVICULUM_NO_AUTO**
:   `1` turns every medium of the automatic layer off, whatever the `[auto]` section says (`reason=env`). `0` lifts the host marker */etc/leviculum/no-auto*. Interfaces the file names are never touched.

## FILES

*/etc/reticulum/config*
:   System-wide configuration, used when it exists. The Debian package installs one here, which is also what lets Python clients find the running daemon without extra flags.

*~/.config/reticulum/config*
:   Per-user configuration, used when the system-wide file is absent.

*~/.reticulum/config*
:   Final fallback (INI format, same as Python Reticulum).

*/etc/leviculum/no-auto*
:   Host marker: while it exists, the automatic layer is off on every start (`reason=marker`), unless `LEVICULUM_NO_AUTO=0`. Installed on rig and coder hosts by `scripts/install-ci.sh`.

*<config_dir>/storage/*
:   Storage directory for identities, known destinations, and cached path state.

The three configuration directories are tried in that order, matching Python-Reticulum's own lookup.

## SIGNALS

**SIGINT**, **SIGTERM**
:   Graceful shutdown.

**SIGUSR1**
:   Dump diagnostic state to stderr; see DIAGNOSTIC DUMP.

## DIAGNOSTIC DUMP

The SIGUSR1 dump lists the estimated size of every tracked table, the `=== Total estimated ===` line, the process RSS, and three sections that say where the rest of the memory sits.

`=== Allocator ===` prints glibc's own balance sheet (`mallinfo2`: arena, ordblks, hblks, hblkhd, uordblks, fordblks, keepcost) and the thread count. The shipped musl-static builds have no `mallinfo2` and run lnsd on mimalloc rather than the libc allocator, so there the section says it is unavailable and only the thread count is measured. The startup log line `Allocator:` and the `+mimalloc` in `lnsd --version` say which allocator a binary runs.

`=== Mappings ===` buckets the process's anonymous writable mappings by size (under 64 KiB, 64 KiB to 1 MiB, 1 to 8 MiB, 8 to 64 MiB, above) with count and bytes per bucket, then names the ten largest by address. Thread stacks show up as regions of about 2 MiB each, so a growing count in one bucket points at an owner class without a debugger.

The `gap:` line starts from RSS plus swap and subtracts the tracked total, the allocator's free bytes (fordblks + keepcost) and its mmapped bytes (hblkhd) in turn, printing what is left after each. A term the libc cannot report is printed as `n/a` and subtracts nothing; hblkhd counts live large allocations, so it can overlap the tracked total.

## EXAMPLES

Start with default config and verbose logging:

    lnsd -v

Start with a custom config directory:

    lnsd --config /etc/reticulum
