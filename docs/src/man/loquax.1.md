## DESCRIPTION

**loquax** is the Leviculum messenger: with no subcommand it opens the conversation view, and **send**, **fetch** and **address** are the commands for scripts. It sends and receives LXMF messages over Reticulum, attaches to a shared instance that is already running -- **lnsd**(1), or Python's **rnsd** -- and runs its own LXMF router; it never starts a Reticulum stack of its own. Its address is a pure function of the identity in its state directory, minted on first use and never replaced silently.

**send** queues one message. The body is the argument, or standard input when the argument is missing or `-`, one trailing newline removed. A send that worked prints nothing and exits 0, which means the message was queued and handed to the network, not that it was delivered. **--via auto**, the default, tries a direct delivery link first and falls back to a propagation node when none comes up; exit 3 says a propagation node holds the message. A message that went onto the link and got no delivery proof in time is not sent again through a propagation node, which would deliver it twice; the run says so and exits 1.

**fetch** collects what the propagation node holds for you and prints what is new on standard output. On a client of a Loquax Mailbox it pulls from the mailbox instead (see LOQUAX MAILBOX).

**address** prints this machine's LXMF address.

**import** and **export** bring a user's identity, contacts and history over from another messenger, and take them out again (see IMPORT AND EXPORT).

**loquax** without a subcommand, or **loquax tui** under its old name, is the interactive messenger: conversations on the left, the open conversation on the right with a compose box under it (see THE SCREEN). A message sent from it travels the way **send --via auto** sends it, and each sent message carries a delivery mark (see DELIVERY MARKS). A restart shows every conversation again from the history (see HISTORY); **--to** lists a correspondent the history does not hold yet, to write first. The packages ship it; a build from source without the `tui` cargo feature has only the script commands, and a plain **loquax** there says so and exits 2.

## OPTIONS

**--instance** *name*
:   Shared-instance name to join, overriding the Reticulum config file's. All subcommands but **address**.

**--config** *dir*
:   Reticulum config directory; only its instance name and RPC key are read. Default: the platform default.

**--pn** *hash*
:   The propagation node to use, remembered as your choice. Without it the `propagation_node` key in Loquax's config decides; without either, the node an earlier run adopted, or a newly adopted one: the most recently heard node that does not run on this device. **send**, **fetch** and **tui**.

**--timeout** *secs*
:   **send**: seconds to get the message onto the network, per leg of **--via auto** (default 30). **fetch**: seconds for the whole drain (default 60). **tui**: per leg of each send, a fetch getting twice that.

**--via** **auto**|**direct**|**propagated**
:   **send** only: how the message travels.

**--title** *text*, **--from** *name*
:   **send** only: the LXMF title, and the name recipients see as the sender (default: `LNMSG_DISPLAY_NAME`, then the account name).

**--sync-interval** *interval*
:   **tui** only: the longest the propagation node goes unsynced (see PROPAGATION NODE), `15m` by default, over the config file's `sync_interval`. A number with `s`, `m` or `h`, minutes without one; `off` or `0` turns the timer off, and the propagation node is then synced at start, on resume from suspend and on `Ctrl-r` only. A key script syncs by itself only when its command line names this option.

**--to** *address*
:   **tui** only, repeatable: a correspondent to list from the start, for writing first to someone the history (see HISTORY) does not hold yet.

**--ascii**
:   **tui** only: draw the delivery marks in ASCII.

**--no-color**
:   **tui** only: no colours. Alignment, the glyphs and reverse video for the selection, the badge and the toast carry everything, as they do in every colour tier too. **NO_COLOR** does the same.

**--color** `auto`|`truecolor`|`256`|`16`
:   **tui** only: the colour tier. `auto` (the default) takes true colour when **COLORTERM** is `truecolor` or `24bit`, the 256-colour palette when **TERM** contains `256color`, no colour when **TERM** is `dumb` or unset, and the sixteen ANSI colours otherwise. **--no-color** and **NO_COLOR** win over it.

**--theme** `auto`|`dark`|`light`
:   **tui** only: dark or light colours. `auto` asks the terminal for its background and takes dark when it does not answer within 100 ms. Over the config file's `theme` key; the palette's `theme` swaps the two for the session.

**--no-mouse**
:   **tui** only: leave the mouse to the terminal. Its own selection and copy then work as in any other program, and Loquax sees no click, wheel or drag; the palette's `mouse` captures it again, and turns it off again.

**--graphics** `auto`|`kitty`|`sixel`|`octant`|`blocks`|`halfblocks`|`braille-thin`|`mosaic`|`braille`
:   **tui** only: how the map is drawn (see MAP). `auto`, the default, takes the way you last stayed on in this terminal, else the most beautiful one the terminal can show: kitty or sixel where it answers for one, octants where it draws them itself, `blocks` in a local terminal with 256 colours or more, `braille-thin` over mosh, in Termux and at 16 colours, braille without colour. The others force one.

**--script** *file*, **--frames** *file*, **--size** *W*x*H*
:   **tui** only: run a key script instead of reading the keyboard, and write each frame it asks for to **--frames** (default: the script's path with `.frames`), on a screen of **--size** (default 80x24). One step a line, `#` a comment: `key` *name* (`tab`, `backtab`, `enter`, `esc`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `backspace`, `delete`, `space`, `f1` to `f12`, or one character, after any of the prefixes `ctrl-`, `alt-` and `shift-`, so `shift-enter` and `ctrl-enter` too), `type` *text*, `newline` (Alt-Enter, a line break in compose), `keyboard` `enhanced`|`plain` (the keyboard the screen is told it has: its hint offers `Shift-Enter` and `Ctrl-Enter` only when enhanced; plain until said), `tick` [*n*], `sleep` *ms* (up to 60000: read the engine as the idle screen does and tick once per 250 ms of *ms*), `frame` [*label*], and `until ready`, `until delivery` *state*, `until received` *n*, `until named` *n* (*n* peers have announced a name), `until leg` `direct`|`propagated` (the send runner reported that leg for the newest sent message), `until map` (no map region load runs or waits), `until synced` *n* (*n* fetches, on a client pulls, have ended), each with an optional timeout in seconds (default 30), and `clock` *YYYY-MM-DD* *HH:MM* (the time of day from then on, at UTC; a script starts at 2026-10-26 12:00 and never reads the wall clock, so its frames are the same on every run). A script draws without colour and dark, whatever the terminal it runs in, until `tier` `mono`|`16`|`256`|`truecolor` and `theme` `dark`|`light` say otherwise; `styles` *name* writes the screen's colours as a map to the frames file's path with `.styles` added, one letter a cell: `.` your block, `,` theirs, `=` the date pill, `!` the `new` rule, `^` a selected block or reverse video, `t` the toast, `e` the error colour, blank the terminal's own. The mouse steps take screen cells counted from 1 at the top left, as the frames' rows and columns are: `click` *col* *row* (the left button down and up), `wheel` `up`|`down` *col* *row* [*n*] (*n* notches, 1 by default) and `drag` *col* *row* *col* *row* (down at the first cell, moved to the second and up there). What the screen asks of the terminal goes into the frames where it happens: `--- osc52` *sequence* `---` for a copy, the escape character written `\e`, and `--- open` *url* `---` for a link, which a script never launches. *state* is one of `queued`, `inflight`, `sent`, `pn` (waiting at a propagation node; `mailbox`, its name before, is still read), `delivered`, `rejected`, `failed`. An `until` that does not hold in time draws a last frame and exits 1.

## LOQUAX MAILBOX

Loquax Mailbox is the always-on part: one machine that holds the LXMF identity and keeps every message it receives while your other devices are off; those devices are its clients and read from it, so no device purges what another has not seen. "Mailbox" means this, your own machine, and nothing else: somebody else's store-and-forward node is a propagation node (see PROPAGATION NODE). The concept is `docs/src/concepts/loquax-home-node.md`, where it is still called the home node, as the code calls it. Both halves are in the packaged build; a build without the `tui` cargo feature has neither. **loquax home** is the old spelling of **loquax mailbox** and still works, every subcommand under it too.

**mailbox run**, or **--daemon** under its old name, runs the mailbox in the foreground, headless, beside a running **lnsd** until SIGINT or SIGTERM. It receives for the identity in its state directory, so senders deliver directly and get their proof; announces at start and every 360 minutes; keeps every received message in the archive, packed as it came, under a sequence; answers its admitted devices; collects from the propagation node on its schedule (see PROPAGATION NODE); and sends what its clients hand it (below). It takes **--instance**, **--config**, **--pn**, **--sync-interval** and **--timeout** as the messenger does. It logs to stderr (`warn,loquax=info`; **RUST_LOG** replaces it): a `HOME up` line, one `HOME archived` line a message, a line for each admission and refusal, and `HOME send accepted` and `HOME outbox` lines for each message sent and each of its legs and states; a message's text never. The mailbox and the messenger refuse to run on the same state directory at once: both would register the same delivery destination (`$LNMSG_HOME/delivery.lock`, see FILES). **send** and **fetch** on the mailbox's own state directory refuse while it runs, naming its pid, and the mailbox does not start while one of them runs; send and fetch from a client instead.

**The system service.** The package ships `loquax-mailbox.service`, disabled: it runs **loquax mailbox run** as the system user `loquax`, with its state in `/var/lib/loquax-mailbox` (mode 0700), after **lnsd**, attached to the system **lnsd**'s shared instance through `/etc/reticulum`, and restarts it when it fails. **mailbox enable** enables and starts it (`systemctl enable --now`), **mailbox disable** stops and disables it; both need root. The service's state is not your own: run the commands below for it as its user, `sudo -u loquax LNMSG_HOME=/var/lib/loquax-mailbox loquax mailbox admit`. Removing the package keeps the state; purging it deletes the identity with it. The service cannot read the system **lnsd**'s RPC key (`/etc/reticulum/storage/transport_identity` is the daemon's alone, mode 0600), so it cannot read the path table and adopts no propagation node by itself: set `propagation_node` in `/var/lib/loquax-mailbox/config`, or name one with **--pn** in a drop-in.

**Sending through the mailbox.** A client hands each message to the mailbox, which signs it with the identity, keeps it in its outbox and answers at once; the client may go to sleep. The mailbox delivers directly over a link at once. When that fails (the router's five attempts), it hands the same message to its propagation node, the one **--pn**, the config or the last collection selected (with none and **--sync-interval off** it says so once per message in its log, and only direct retries remain), and keeps trying directly on every announce of the recipient and every `outbox_retry_secs` (an hour by default), for `outbox_days` (seven by default). The copy on the propagation node is encrypted for the recipient, so it goes once the mailbox has heard the recipient's announce at least once. A direct delivery proof makes the message delivered even after the propagation node took a copy: the recipient keeps one message per hash. The outbox is kept in the history file, so a restart goes on retrying. Each state (accepted, propagated, delivered, failed, retries ended) is an archive entry, so every client sees it on its next pull.

**mailbox admit** [**--name** *name*] [**--server** *host*:*port*], on the mailbox, opens a single-use admission for one device and prints its code, `lqxh1` and 135 more characters: the identity's public key and a token, and with **--server** the mailbox's TCP server as a phone reaches it, so the phone needs one scan; and the code as a QR code. The device is listed under *name* (default `device-`*n*). The mailbox need not be running.

**mailbox join** *code*, on the new device, makes its own device identity, links to the mailbox, identifies and redeems the token; from then on the device is a client. A code works once, and for `home_token_hours` (24 by default) after **mailbox admit** printed it. It takes **--instance**, **--config** and **--timeout** (seconds for the path, the link and the answer; 60 by default).

**mailbox devices**, on the mailbox, lists the admitted devices: hash, name, when admitted.

**mailbox tokens**, on the mailbox, lists the codes not yet used and not yet expired: the token's first eight hex characters, the name, when it expires. **mailbox revoke-token** *prefix* withdraws one, by the start of its hash (four hex characters are enough when they are unique).

**mailbox revoke** *device*, on the mailbox, removes a device, named by its name or its hash (four hex characters are enough when they are unique). A name two devices share removes neither and lists both. The mailbox checks every request, so a revoked device is refused at once.

**On a client** the messenger pulls from the mailbox at start, on the propagation node's schedule, and on `F5`, `Ctrl-r` and the palette's `fetch`, and shows the mailbox's address as its own; **address** prints it; **fetch** pulls and prints what is new. Pulling deletes nothing on the mailbox, and every client reads every message. A client checks each message's signature itself. **send** and the compose line hand the message to the mailbox (see "Sending through the mailbox" above) and are done once it answered; **send** ignores **--via** and **--pn** there, since the mailbox decides. Right after a send the client pulls, so the bubble shows `sent` once the mailbox has the message and takes each later state from the archive; **send** prints what that pull brings as **fetch** does, its own `message` *id* `accepted` line among it, since the device keeps one cursor. **fetch** prints a line `message` *id* *state* for each state change.

**Read and sent state on every client.** What a client's messenger reads is read on every client of the mailbox: opening a conversation marks its unread messages, and a message arriving in the open conversation, as read with the mailbox, and the other clients apply it on their next pull. A message deleted on a client is deleted on every client; on a client the delete question says so. A message one client sent shows on the others as a sent bubble. A mark the mailbox did not take is said in `tui.log` (`HOME mark ... not taken`) and not tried again.

## KEYS

In **tui**, the focus follows the pane. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` cycle the conversations, the messages and the compose line. `?` (or `F1` from any pane) shows every key; the help, the footer and the palette are built from the same table the keys are.

In the messages, `y` or `Alt-w` copies what a drag selected (see MOUSE), or else the message under the cursor whole. `d` deletes the message under the cursor from this device after asking: `y` deletes it, any other key keeps it (see HISTORY). `e` reacts to the message under the cursor (see REACTIONS).

In the conversations and the messages: `j`/`k`, the arrows or `Ctrl-n`/`Ctrl-p` move, `Ctrl-f`/`Ctrl-b`, `Space` and `PageDown`/`PageUp` page, `Ctrl-d`/`Ctrl-u` move half a page, `g`/`G`, `Home`/`End`, `Alt-<`/`Alt->` or `Ctrl-↑`/`Ctrl-↓` jump to the top or bottom. `Enter` opens the selected conversation; on a message it opens the message: one that carries a position, a report or a text with a telemetry field, the map at its fix (see TELEMETRY), any other message its detail view (see THE SCREEN), which `v` opens for every message. `i`, `a` or `r` start writing. `:` opens the command palette (`:q` and `Enter` quit), `Ctrl-r` checks the propagation node outside a search, `q` quits. `/` searches (see SEARCH).

In the compose line, keys type. `Enter` sends to the open conversation (an empty line sends nothing). `Alt-Enter` and `Ctrl-j` break the line; where the terminal speaks the keyboard enhancement protocol, `Shift-Enter` breaks it too and `Ctrl-Enter` sends, and never breaks it. The compose pane's border names the two chords live in this terminal. The Emacs keys edit: `Ctrl-a`/`Ctrl-e` and `Home`/`End` the line's start and end, `Alt-<`/`Alt->` the body's, `Ctrl-p`/`Ctrl-n` and the arrows move a line, `Ctrl-b`/`Ctrl-f` a character, `Alt-b`/`Alt-f` a word, `Ctrl-d` deletes forward, `Alt-d` and `Alt-Backspace` delete a word, `Ctrl-k` kills to the end and `Ctrl-y` yanks. `Ctrl-c` clears the line into the kill buffer (`Ctrl-y` brings it back). `Esc` or `Ctrl-g` go back to the messages, and from there to the conversations. `PageDown`/`PageUp` page the messages.

**send_on_enter**: with `send_on_enter = false` in `$LNMSG_HOME/config`, or after the palette's `send on enter`, `Enter` breaks the line and `Alt-Enter` sends (`Ctrl-Enter` too, where the terminal can send it).

Everywhere: `Alt-x` opens the command palette, which matches what you type against the actions' names (`send`, `fetch`, `quit`, `help`, `details`, `next conversation`, `send on enter`, `mouse`, `theme`, `search`, `delete message`, `delete conversation`, `pin`, `rename`, `react`, `block`, `unblock`, `blocked`, `map drawing`, ...); a name typed whole, or its start, is offered first. `Alt-↓`/`Alt-↑` select the next or previous conversation, `Alt-Shift-↓`/`Alt-Shift-↑` the next or previous one with unread messages. `Ctrl-s` opens the search, or goes back to its field. `F5` checks the propagation node, `Ctrl-l` redraws the screen, `Ctrl-q` quits. `Ctrl-c` quits nowhere; outside compose it says that `Ctrl-q` does.

## PROPAGATION NODE

A propagation node is somebody else's machine that holds mail for you while you are away (**lnpnd**(1), or Python's lxmd); it sees every message's envelope and is chosen, not trusted. It is not your mailbox (see LOQUAX MAILBOX). **tui** collects mail from the propagation node by itself: at start, when the computer wakes from suspend, when the node announces (at most once a minute), and on a timer, besides `Ctrl-r`, `F5` and the palette's `fetch`. The interval (**--sync-interval**, default 15 minutes) is a promise: the next sync never starts later than that after the last one, and an empty node never stretches it. After a message comes in from the node or goes out from you, it syncs every 2 minutes for the next 10, then at the interval again; below 15 minutes both shrink with it (`5m` gives every 40 s for 200 s), so one burst is always five syncs. A sync that fails is tried again after 30 s, then 1, 2, 4 minutes, never later than the interval. The conversation's title says when the last sync was and when the next one is due, `propagation node 9c31e0a2 adopted · synced 14:05 · next 14:20`, shorter on a narrow screen with the next sync kept longest and `pn` for the word, and `fetching` while one runs. A sync the timer started says only what came (`2 new message(s)`) and the first failure of a row; one you asked for says how it went either way. `tui.log` has a `SYNC reason=` line for each, `start`, `resume`, `announce`, `timer` or `key`.

**The cost on LoRa.** An empty sync at SF8, 125 kHz, coding rate 4/5 (18 preamble symbols, the RNode's one header byte a packet) is six packets when the link to the node has to be built: the link request (86 bytes, 298 ms), its proof (118 bytes, 380 ms), the round-trip packet (83 bytes, 288 ms), your identification (211 bytes, 615 ms), the request for the list (99 bytes, 329 ms) and the empty answer (99 bytes, 329 ms), together about 2.2 s of airtime on the channel; over a link still up from the last sync, the request and the answer, 0.66 s. A path request, when the node's path is not known, adds 206 ms. At the default interval that is four syncs an hour and at most 9 s of airtime, 0.25 % of the hour; a burst after a message adds about 11 s. At `1m` the timer alone takes up to 134 s an hour, 3.7 %: more than the 1 % most of the EU 868 MHz band allows a sender, though inside the 10 % of the 869.4 to 869.65 MHz part. A sync with something to fetch costs the messages' own size on top.

## THE SCREEN

**The list.** Two rows a conversation, the most recent first: its name (see NAMES), the time of its last message (`14:05` today, the weekday this week, else the date), then the last line, `you:` before it when it was yours, and in brackets the count of messages not yet read. The selected conversation has a bar in the margin, reversed while the list has the focus. Pinned conversations (see HISTORY) stand first, above a dotted rule. The conversation's title says the peer, its trust in words (see NAMES) and the propagation node: the selected node, how it was chosen and when this session last fetched from it.

**A message** is a block: yours flush right, theirs flush left, at most three quarters of the pane wide, the text wrapped at a space and a line break kept, and the time closing the last line, for yours with its delivery mark (see DELIVERY MARKS). A centred date separates the days, and the top of the conversation says `nothing earlier on this device` where the history begins, or how many older messages it holds above what is loaded (see HISTORY). On a pane narrower than 40 cells yours are drawn flush left too, with `you` before the time. A message is drawn selected behind a bar while the conversation has the focus and the cursor is on it.

**Colour.** In colour your blocks are tinted blue and theirs grey, each a rectangle of its text with a cell of margin either side; the time takes a softer colour of its block, the date sits on a pill of its own between dashes, and the `new` rule takes an accent. A selected block takes a stronger tint; in 16 colours and without colour it is reversed. On a dark terminal in 16 colours their blocks are not tinted. Colour only reinforces: the side is where the block sits, the delivery state is the glyph, the unread count is a word.

**The `new` rule.** Where the messages begin that arrived while the conversation was not open, or while you were reading earlier ones, a full-width rule says how many (`2 new`). It stays until you leave the conversation. A message that arrives while you have scrolled up draws the rule above it and does not move what you are reading; `G` or `End` goes back to the newest, and from there the conversation follows what arrives.

**The detail view.** `Enter` on a message, or `v` on any message, a position report too, shows who wrote it to whom, the peer's address, the message's id in full, its size and its state, and what this device saw happen to it, across restarts, each with its time: queued, the leg tried, the router's states, the delivery proof, or the reason it failed. `Esc` or `q` closes it.

## NAMES

A peer is named the way its own client announces itself, followed by the first four hex digits of its address: `Alice ·4f2a`. Your own name for a peer, a petname from `$LNMSG_HOME/contacts`, wins over the announced one. A peer that has announced no name and has no petname is its address's first eight hex digits in angle brackets, `<9c31e0a2…>`. A name heard is kept in the history (see HISTORY) and names the peer after a restart, until it announces again.

A name off the network is drawn sanitised: control characters, direction overrides and invisible characters are removed, white space is one space, a glyph the screen uses for a meaning of its own (a delivery mark, `·`, `…`, `«`, `»`, `≈`, box drawing) is shown as `?`, and it is cut with `…` at 32 cells, a wide character counting two. What is forwarded or stored is not changed.

Two peers whose names look alike (the same letters ignoring case, full-width forms, and the Cyrillic, Greek and digit letters that look like Latin ones) both carry `≈` after the hash, and the title of an open one says `same name as ·b7d0`. A peer that announces a different name than before says so once in its conversation: `── was Alice, now announces Ally ──`.

The title's trust state is one of three words: `known`, a peer you named; `blocked`, one you blocked; else `unknown`. Beside a petname the title also says what the peer announces (`known · announces Alice`).

The palette names and blocks the open conversation's peer, and writes `contacts` as it goes, changing only that peer's lines and keeping every comment and other line. `rename` turns the palette into a text field holding the peer's petname: `Enter` sets what it holds, an empty field clears the petname, `Esc` changes nothing. `block` blocks the peer and `unblock` lifts it. A blocked peer's messages are still received, proven and kept in the history, so the sender sees them delivered; they are only not shown: the conversation leaves the list and the search, counts nothing unread, raises no notice, and its positions are not pinned on the map. The palette's `blocked` turns the list into the blocked conversations, titled `Blocked`, where they open with their messages; `blocked` again, or `unblock`, which shows the conversation in the list with its history, goes back.

## REACTIONS

A reaction is an emoji, or a short text, attached to an earlier message: the LXMF reaction field, which Columba, Ratspeak and MeshChatX send and read. Under a message its reactions are drawn on one row, each once with how many sent it when more than one did, yours in brackets: `👍 2  [❤️]`. A reaction is never a message of its own on the screen: it counts nothing unread and moves no cursor, and a text an older client wrote beside it (`Reacted to your message with ...`) is not shown. One that arrives before the message it reacts to is kept and appears when that message does. A blocked peer's reactions are kept and not shown.

`e` on a message, or the palette's `react`, opens the picker: `1` to `6` send 👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 😡 at once, the six Columba offers; anything typed is sent with `Enter`, at most 16 characters, and `Esc` sends nothing. A reaction is sent as any message is, direct or through a propagation node, with no text of its own. It cannot be taken back or changed: the field has no way to say so.

## SEARCH

`/` in the conversations or the messages, or `Ctrl-s` anywhere (`Ctrl-Shift-F` too, where the terminal speaks the keyboard enhancement protocol), turns the list into the search: its title says `Search` and `esc closes`, and the cursor is in its field at the top. As you type, the list under the field becomes the results, ignoring case: first the conversations whose name matches (the name as the list shows it, with its short hash, or the address for a peer with no name), then every message in the history whose text matches, each group with its count and the most recent first. A result is two rows, who and when over a preview, with the first match between `«` and `»`; a message you wrote reads `you to` its conversation. `no matches` says the query found nothing, and an empty field shows the plain list. Messages older than what a conversation has loaded are found in the history's index and listed among the others; opening one loads its conversation down to it.

`Tab` goes from the field to the results, where the moving keys and `n`/`N` step through them; `Ctrl-s`/`Ctrl-r` step them from the field too. `Enter` opens the selected result: a conversation at its newest message, a message's conversation at that message, selected, with the match marked in its block. The search stays open, every matching block of the open conversation is marked, and there `n`/`N` and `Ctrl-s`/`Ctrl-r` move to the next or previous matching message, round to the other end past the last. `Esc` in the conversation goes back to the results, and `Esc` (or `Ctrl-g`) in the results or the field closes the search: the list comes back, and the conversation keeps what it shows. While a search is open `Ctrl-r` is the previous match, not a fetch; `F5` fetches.

## HISTORY

**tui** keeps every conversation in `$LNMSG_HOME/history.sqlite3`: the messages both ways with their delivery marks and what their detail view lists, which conversations are pinned and how many messages are unread, and the names peers announced. A restart shows it all again, under the same address; another identity in the same directory has a history of its own.

A conversation opens with its newest 200 messages. Scrolling to the top loads 200 more, and the top line says how many the history still holds (`180 earlier on this device, scroll up for them`) until it reaches the first: `nothing earlier on this device`.

A message you sent that was still on its way when Loquax ended is `○` again after the restart, with `Loquax restarted: no longer being sent` in its detail view. Nothing sends it again; send it anew if it matters.

Message text is kept until you delete it. `d` on a message, then `y`, deletes it from this device; any other key keeps it, and a message still being sent cannot be deleted until it settles. The palette's `delete conversation` deletes the open conversation and its messages the same way, after asking, and `pin` puts the open conversation above the others, under a dotted rule, or takes it back down. Deleting is local: the peer keeps what you sent and what they sent you.

What **send** and **fetch** handle on the command line is not written to the history.

## IMPORT AND EXPORT

**import** reads what another LXMF messenger keeps and asks, for each source it found, three questions in this order: contacts and names (default yes), the history (default yes) and the identity (default no). Enter takes the default; the identity is adopted only when you type `yes` after a warning. Without a *path* it looks only in the apps' documented default places, one level deep: NomadNet's `~/.nomadnetwork`, `~/.config/nomadnetwork` and `/etc/nomadnetwork`; the raw identity files of Sideband (`~/.config/sideband/app_storage/primary_identity`), MeshChat (`~/.reticulum-meshchat/identity`), MeshChatX (`~/.reticulum-meshchatx/identities/*/identity`) and Ratspeak (`~/.local/share/org.ratspeak.desktop/.ratspeak/identities/*/identity`); and in `~/Downloads` the files named `*.rnsidentity`, `*-reticulum-identity.identity`, `reticulum.raw-private-key` and `identity.bin`. It lists one line per source with its address and counts before it reads anything more. A Ratspeak identity under a passcode is listed and not read. A *path* is read as whatever it is: a NomadNet directory, a Loquax export, a raw 64-byte identity file, a file holding a Base32 key, or a copy of Ratspeak's `ratspeak.db` (see Ratspeak below). **--key** reads a Base32 key, as Sideband, Columba, MeshChatX and Ratspeak export it, from the first line of standard input, never from the command line. **--dry-run** lists what would be written, per conversation with counts of new, already held and unreadable messages, and writes nothing.

**Contacts** are NomadNet's named peers, as petnames in `$LNMSG_HOME/contacts`, and its `ignored` peers, as blocks; a petname you already gave a peer stays. On a Loquax Mailbox the names and blocks go into its archive too, and every client takes them on its next sync; a name or block state a client already set for that peer stays. NomadNet's propagation node becomes Loquax's only when Loquax has none; its display name is shown, not taken.

**History** is written under the address it belongs to, the source's: it is the conversation view's history once that identity is Loquax's, and waits in the store until then. A message keeps its LXMF id, so running the import again, or importing the same history twice, adds nothing. Imported messages sort before Loquax's own in their conversation, in the source's time order. Loquax checks a signature itself where it can: your own sent messages against the source's identity, and a received message whose bytes are intact is kept until its sender's key comes, as a received one is. NomadNet stores a message with an attachment without it, which breaks the signature; such a message is unverified, and the detail view says what NomadNet said of it (`NomadNet said: signature verified`), never as Loquax's verdict. Attachments are counted and skipped; Loquax has no attachment store yet. On a Loquax Mailbox the imported messages go into its archive too, with their signature checks and held bytes, and every client takes them on its next sync. Each source and conversation leaves an `IMPORT` line in `$LNMSG_HOME/import.log` with its counts, never a key or a message's text.

**Ratspeak.** Copy `ratspeak.db` out of Ratspeak's data directory (with Ratspeak stopped) and name the copy; Loquax never looks for it and only reads it. Ratspeak's schemas 33 and 45 are read; any other is refused, naming the ones read and the one found. Of the identities the database holds, the one whose address is Loquax's is imported (adopt it first from Ratspeak's Base32 export with **import --key**), or the only one; **--dry-run** lists them all with their counts. Messages, contacts with Ratspeak's names, blocks and the propagation node come over; a message deleted in Ratspeak stays deleted. Ratspeak keeps no signed message, so every imported message is unverified and its detail view says `imported, no signature: Ratspeak keeps none`. A reply keeps its link where the message it answers is imported too, and reactions come over as reactions; attachments are lost (and counted). Ratspeak's times are unix seconds, UTC already, and are taken as they are, whatever the zone. On a Loquax Mailbox the imported messages go into its archive too, and every client takes them on its next sync.

**The identity.** Adopting it makes Loquax answer on the source's address. Do not run both apps on one identity at the same time: both announce it, so a direct message reaches only one; both collect from the same propagation node, and the first to sync takes the mail. Loquax's own identity is not deleted: it moves to `$LNMSG_HOME/identity.`*address*`.bak`, its history stays in the store under its address, and moving the file back to `identity` switches back. The new `identity` is written with mode 0600. On a client of a Loquax Mailbox, adopt on the mailbox.

The palette's `import` imports contacts and history from the sources found in the default places, never the identity; what it wrote shows at once.

On the very first start of the conversation view (no identity, no history, no config in `$LNMSG_HOME`) and on a terminal, Loquax scans the default places before it mints an identity and asks the same questions when it found something. Found nothing, it says nothing.

**export** writes Loquax's identity, contacts and history into *dir*, which must not exist or be empty, in NomadNet's shape: `storage/identity` (the raw private key, mode 0600; keep the directory safe), `storage/directory`, `ignored`, `storage/peersettings` and one LXMF container per message under `storage/conversations/`. NomadNet and **loquax import** read it. A received message whose signed bytes Loquax still holds goes out as those bytes; a message you sent is signed again with your identity; any other received message carries an empty signature and Loquax's verdict on it, which an import shows as Loquax's word.

## TELEMETRY

**tui** reads the positions peers send in their messages: the telemetry field of Sideband, Columba and the leviculum boards, and a collector's stream of other peers' positions. A report with no text is one line in the conversation, `◎ position 43.77310 N 11.25600 E`, beside the time it arrived; reports that follow each other fold into the latest one. A message with text and a position shows its text, and the position is taken all the same.

The open conversation's title carries the peer's latest position. A wide screen shows it in the row under the title, `at 43.77310 N 11.25600 E · ±5 m · 4 min ago`, the accuracy only where the peer gave one; on a narrow one the title says `pos 4 min`. The age counts from the fix, not from when the message arrived, and a fix older than two hours is drawn dimmed, its age still beside it. A fix stamped ahead of this computer's clock is shown with its claimed time, `fix 16:00, ahead of our clock`, and does not count as newer than the fixes that follow it. A text that came with a position shows the same line under its text, and opens the map the same way. `Enter` on a report's line, or a click on it, opens the map centred on that report's fix, at the deepest zoom the region under it has (the outline's deepest without one), the sender's pin selected; `Esc` brings the conversation back with the cursor where it was. A folded line stands for the latest report of its run and opens that one. A click on the position in the header, `L` in the list or a conversation, or `Alt-l` anywhere puts the open conversation's peer on the map the same way, at its latest fix. `v` opens a report's detail view, which lists every sensor it carried: position, altitude, speed, bearing, accuracy, fix time, battery, link and temperature. A report that cannot be read is kept as it came and named in `$LNMSG_HOME/tui.log` as `TELEMETRY_UNREADABLE`.

Every position is kept in the history with the message it came in; one fix that arrives twice, directly and again in a collector's stream, is kept once. Deleting a conversation deletes the positions its peer reported.

Loquax sends no telemetry: it never sends your position and answers no request for it.

## MAP

`M` in the list or a conversation, `Alt-m` anywhere, or the palette's `map` puts the map in the conversation's place; the list stays beside it. It shows a pin for every peer with a known position, `● name · age`, the name as the list gives it and the age of the fix, dimmed once it is older than two hours; your own position, when a collector reported it, is `you`. The selected pin is `◉` (`@` and `*` with **--ascii**). On open every pin is in view; opened from a position report or from the peer's position (see TELEMETRY), it is centred on that fix instead.

In the map, `t` (or `F2`) draws it the next way and `T` the way before, at once, the title naming the new one a moment; `g` puts the glyph test over it and takes it away again (see below). `+` (or `=`) and `-` zoom, the arrows and `h` `j` `k` `l` pan by an eighth of the view, `H` `J` `K` `L` and Shift with an arrow by half, `0` puts every pin in view again, and `d` (or the palette's `load map area`) loads the map of the visible area. `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` step through the pins by name, `Enter` opens the selected peer's conversation, and `Esc` or `Ctrl-g` brings the conversation back. Drag with the left button to pan: the map follows the pointer, and the point that was under it when the button went down stays under it. A click on a pin opens its conversation; a drag that starts on a pin opens nothing. The wheel zooms about the pointer; tilted left or right, as a touch terminal may send a sideways swipe, it pans an eighth of the view as `h` and `l` do. The picture is drawn beside the keyboard, so a held key or a drag shows the newest view as soon as it is drawn, not every view it passed. The palette (`:` or `Alt-x`), the help (`?`), `F5` and `Ctrl-q` work there as elsewhere.

The map loads what it shows by itself. Going to a place, a position report's line or the peer's position (see TELEMETRY), or opening the map with pins no region holds, loads the region around the place: a box of 12 by 12 km, zooms 10 to 15, a few megabytes for a city (3.9 MB for central Frankfurt, 7.9 MB for central Berlin, 1.3 MB for the countryside, measured 2026-10-28). The map shows what is there at once, the title says `loading map`, and the region is drawn as soon as it lands, the map fitted to it when you have not moved it meanwhile. `d` loads the visible area: its box, from three zooms above the view's to zoom 15; a large area loads with fewer of the deep zooms, never more than 64 MB of tiles, and one too large even at the view's own zoom says so (zoom in). An area already loaded says so too. One region loads at a time; a load that fails says why once, as a toast and as a `MAPLOAD failed` line in `tui.log`, and that box is not asked again for 30 s, then a minute, doubling to an hour. Without internet the map says so once and keeps working with what is there. Every load is a `MAPLOAD start`, `MAPLOAD done` (with `bytes=`, `fetched=` and `elapsed_ms=`) or `MAPLOAD failed` line in `tui.log`.

The regions are cut from a PMTiles archive read by HTTP range requests, only the tiles of the box: by default the newest Protomaps daily build (`https://build.protomaps.com/`*YYYYMMDD*`.pmtiles`, OpenStreetMap data under the ODbL), or the archive `map_source` names in the config (see FILES), for instance your own copy. A loaded region carries the names of its places, waters, parks and streets, the local ones, and beside them the names in your language where they differ (Firenze, Florenz), the language taken from **LC_ALL**, **LC_MESSAGES** or **LANG**, the first one set. **Privacy:** the source learns which areas you look at, as any map server does; `map_autoload = off` stops the loads that start by themselves (the `d` key still loads, since you asked), and `map_source` points them at a server you trust.

Region files live in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/loquax/maps/` (default `~/.local/share/loquax/maps/`), or in `$LNMSG_HOME/maps/` when **LNMSG_HOME** is set, which replaces the default as it does for the identity: every `*.lmr` there. Loaded ones are named `auto-`*box*`-z`*min*`-`*max*`.lmr`; they are a cache of at most `map_cache_mb` megabytes (500 by default), the least recently viewed removed first. A file you placed there yourself, under any other name, is never removed. Every region that reaches into the view is drawn, each inside its own box, so regions side by side join up. A region file can also be cut by hand from a box of the Protomaps daily build (listed at `https://maps.protomaps.com/builds/`) by `leviculum-map-tool` from the leviculum source tree (its README), which reads the archive by range requests too:

    leviculum-map-tool cut -o city.lmr https://build.protomaps.com/20261028.pmtiles \
        --bbox 8.47,50.01,8.80,50.23
    mv city.lmr ~/.local/share/loquax/maps/

The map names what a region names: cities, towns, districts, villages, suburbs and neighbourhoods as the zoom reaches them, larger places first, then waters and parks, rivers, and streets, major roads first. A name is shown in your language where the region has it; a name in a script your language is not written in (Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese, ... for a language written in Latin letters) is shown in English where the region has that. **tui** sets at most one name in each block of 20 by 6 cells, with a free cell around it, in the cells' own background so it stands out from the map, and leaves a name out rather than cutting it; it never covers a pin, a pin's name or a place's name. It names a street on a level stretch at least two cells longer than the name, which a street that climbs has not, and a river where it crosses the middle row of a block; each again 60 cells further on. **gui** sets the names into the picture once the view rests, with a halo of the map's ground, and names streets from zoom 14 and rivers, in blue and slanted, along the straightest runs of each, turned to read left to right; while you drag, the picture moves without them. A region cut before names existed has none, and one cut before rivers were named names no river.

Where no region covers the view, and with none installed, the map is the world outline, Natural Earth's land at 1:50m, as far in as zoom 10. The attribution line under the map names what is drawn, `© OpenStreetMap contributors` for a region and `Natural Earth` for the outline. A region file that does not open is named in `tui.log` and left out.

The map is drawn the most beautiful way the terminal can show, and you can change it while you look. The ways, best first:

- `kitty` and `sixel`: a picture, where the terminal answers for one of the two protocols (foot draws sixel, kitty its own).
- `octant`: 2 x 4 blocks a cell in two colours (Unicode 16, U+1CD00), every area filled and every road in its colour, the finest a cell can show. Taken where the terminal draws these glyphs itself, whatever its font: kitty (`TERM=xterm-kitty`), foot (`TERM=foot`) and WezTerm (`TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm`).
- `blocks`: quadrants and eighth blocks, the best fit a cell: the set nearly every monospace font carries.
- `halfblocks`: two pixels a cell in colour.
- `braille-thin`: braille dots for the roads, one dot wide, in their colour, over the areas' colours as cell backgrounds. Braille is the one glyph family that nearly every font chain draws, Termux's default included.
- `mosaic`: one colour a cell, no glyph at all.
- `braille`: eight dots a cell, the roads and coasts as lines in the terminal's own colour.

`auto` takes kitty or sixel where the terminal answered for one and neither mosh nor tmux sits between (mosh drops the pictures, tmux passes them only where configured to), else octants where the terminal draws them and they arrive, else `blocks` with 256 colours or more, else `braille-thin`; at 16 colours it is `braille-thin` with each class in its own of the sixteen (parks green, water blue), without colour plain braille. Behind mosh no block element is taken (the font at the other end is unknown, and in Termux they came out as empty boxes); octants are, from a terminal that draws them, when the host's glibc is 2.41 or later, since an older mosh-server drops them. mosh is found as a `mosh-server` among Loquax's parent processes; tmux and screen by their variables (`TMUX`, `STY`, `TERM`) or parent processes; Termux by `TERMUX_VERSION`. Colours come from `COLORTERM` and `TERM` (see **--color**).

`t` and `T` step through every way in that order, and the palette's `map drawing` lists them all, the one drawing now marked `●`; a way the facts above say will not show here is still offered, marked `(may not show here)`, because your eyes beat the detection. `g` shows the glyph test, one line for each glyph set as it should look and the ways that need it: a box, a question mark or a gap means your font lacks that set. In Termux, a font file at `~/.termux/font.ttf` with these sets (Cascadia Code has them all) makes every way work.

The way you stay on is remembered when you leave the map or quit, in the config (see FILES), for this terminal: the key is `map_drawing.`*context*, where the context is what sits between (`mosh`, `tmux`, `screen` or `local`), a colon, and `TERM_PROGRAM`, or `TERM` where that is unset, for instance `map_drawing.local:foot` or `map_drawing.mosh:xterm-256color`. So a desktop terminal and a mosh session from the phone each keep their own. Under tmux `TERM_PROGRAM` is `tmux`, so every terminal tmux runs in shares one. At the next start a remembered way wins over `auto`'s choice; one that cannot work at all there (a picture behind mosh) or that this Loquax does not know is passed over for `auto`'s, said once. **--graphics** other than `auto` wins over both. `tui.log` names the way taken once at start and why, as `GRAPHICS backend=braille-thin reason=no-graphics,no-octants,mosh detected=halfblocks between=mosh cell=2x4 zooms=0-10 context=mosh:xterm-256color`, a `GRAPHICS backend=... reason=chosen` line for each change and a `GRAPHICS remembered=` line for each write. The reasons are `forced`, `remembered`, `no-color`, `no-graphics` (the terminal answered for neither kitty nor sixel), `mosh` and `tmux` (it did, behind one; `mosh` also keeps block elements off), `no-octants` (the terminal is not known to draw them), `old-glibc` (it is, behind a mosh-server whose glibc drops them), `termux`, `no-truecolor` (256 colours) and `16-colors`; `best` when the top rung was taken.

## MOUSE

In **tui** the mouse is captured unless **--no-mouse** says otherwise, and the palette's `mouse` switches it off and on. A click on a pane focuses it, and the wheel scrolls the pane under the pointer, whichever has the focus: the list a conversation a notch, the conversation three rows, the compose box a line. A click on a conversation's rows opens it; on its unread count, it opens at the `new` rule. A click on a message selects it where it is, without scrolling; on its delivery mark, it opens the detail view; on a position report or a text with a position, it opens the map at its fix. A click on the peer's position in the conversation's title, or in the row under it, puts the peer on the map. A click in the compose box puts the cursor there. A click on `/ search` on the list's bottom border opens the search; a click on a result opens it, and one on the field puts the cursor back there.

Two clicks transmit, and they are words: `send` on the compose box's border sends, as `Enter` does, and the propagation node's state in the conversation's title (or in the row under it on a wide screen) fetches, as `F5` does. Nothing else the mouse can reach transmits; the footer's `send` is a key to press, not a button.

A footer item runs its key's action, and the pointer over it highlights it. A click outside the palette or a detail view closes it; any click closes the help.

Drag across the conversation to select text, across lines and messages: the release copies the selected text, without the times and the marks, to the clipboard by OSC 52, which works over SSH where the terminal allows it, and says `copied N chars`. `y` copies the selection again.

A link in a message (`http`, `https` and `mailto` URLs, `lxmf@`*address*, a NomadNet page *address*`:/page/...`) is underlined. A click follows it as lnomad does: a web or mail link goes to the system's handler for it, an `lxmf@` address opens its conversation for writing, and a NomadNet page is copied, to open in lnomad. Any other scheme is refused.

Without capture the terminal's own selection works as before: drag to select, and the terminal's copy key copies.

## DELIVERY MARKS

`○` queued; a spinner while a link is built or the bytes go out; `◇` handed to the network, no proof back; `⌂` waiting at a propagation node; `✓` a delivery proof came back; `✗` refused (red) or given up (dim). Only `✓` is green, and only a proof makes it. Each tone has a value per theme and colour tier; in 16 colours a mark takes its block's text colour, and without colour none. With **--ascii**: `.` `*` `o` `^` `v` `x`.

## EXIT STATUS

0 success; 1 operational failure; 2 argument error; 3 (**send**) a propagation node holds the message.

## ENVIRONMENT

**LNMSG_HOME**
:   The state directory (identity, history, propagation node choice, seen record, client storage). Default: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/loquax`, else `~/.config/loquax`. The program was called lnmsg before; when only the old `lnmsg` directory exists there, the first start moves it to `loquax` and says so on stderr. Setting this variable skips that move.

**LNMSG_DISPLAY_NAME**
:   The sender name when **--from** is not given.

**LEVICULUM_EVENT_LOG**
:   Append the run's structured events, including the message id, to this file.

**LOQUAX_INPUT_LOG**
:   Set and not `0`: **tui** writes each event the terminal sends to `$LNMSG_HOME/tui.log` as it came, before Loquax reads anything into it, one `INPUT` line each after an `INPUT log=on` line at start: `INPUT kind=mouse event=scroll_left button=none col=12 row=7 mods=none` (`event` one of `down`, `up`, `drag`, `moved`, `scroll_up`, `scroll_down`, `scroll_left`, `scroll_right`), `INPUT kind=key code=char:h mods=alt state=press` (a printable character as itself, any other as `U+`*hex*), `INPUT kind=resize width=80 height=24`, `INPUT kind=paste len=12` (the length in bytes, never the text) and `INPUT kind=focus gained=true`. It is for finding out what a terminal sends for a gesture, a swipe on a phone for instance; the keys typed are in it, so leave it off otherwise.

**NO_COLOR**
:   Set and not empty: **tui** draws without colour, as **--no-color**.

**COLORTERM**, **TERM**
:   Read by **--color** `auto`; **TERM** also by **--graphics** `auto` (see MAP).

**TERM_PROGRAM**, **TERMUX_VERSION**
:   Read by **--graphics** `auto` and for the context a map drawing is remembered under (see MAP).

## FILES

`$LNMSG_HOME/identity` is your address; back it up. `$LNMSG_HOME/identity.`*address*`.bak` is an identity an import set aside (see IMPORT AND EXPORT), and `$LNMSG_HOME/import.log` the import's log. `$LNMSG_HOME/history.sqlite3` is the history (see HISTORY), an SQLite file that `sqlite3` reads; a backup of it is a copy taken while Loquax is not running. **tui** refuses to start over a history it cannot read whole (cut short, not SQLite, or written by a later Loquax) and names the file: move it aside to start with an empty history, or put a backup in its place. It never starts empty over one. **tui** writes its warnings to `$LNMSG_HOME/tui.log` instead of the screen, with a line for each step of each send leg (`SEND`), each path answer (`PATH`) and each call to the daemon (`RPC`); and once at start a `KEYS` line naming the keyboard and its live chords (`KEYS enhancement=no newline=Alt-Enter send=Enter`) a `GRAPHICS` line naming how the map is drawn (see MAP) and at the end a `GRAPHICS paints=` line counting its pictures, and a `SYNC bound=` line with the propagation node's interval (see PROPAGATION NODE), a `MAPLOAD autoload=` line naming the map's source and a `MAPLOAD` line for each region load (see MAP), and with **LOQUAX_INPUT_LOG** an `INPUT` line for each event the terminal sends (see ENVIRONMENT); **RUST_LOG** replaces its filter (default `warn,loquax=info`). `$LNMSG_HOME/config` holds `key = value` lines: `propagation_node` (see **--pn**), `send_on_enter` (`true`, the default, or `false`), `theme` (`auto`, the default, `dark` or `light`; see **--theme**) `sync_interval` (`15m`, the default, or `off`; see **--sync-interval**), `map_autoload` (`on`, the default, or `off`), `map_source` (the URL of a PMTiles archive; unset, the newest Protomaps daily build), `map_cache_mb` (500, the default; see MAP), `map_theme` (`light`, the default, `dark` or `auto`, which follows `theme` in **tui** and is light in **gui**; the map's colours), on a Loquax Mailbox `archive_cap_mb` (the megabytes of messages the archive keeps before the oldest go; 1024, the default), `home_token_hours` (how long an admission code stays good; 24, the default), `outbox_retry_secs` (how often a message sent through the mailbox is tried direct again besides on every announce of its recipient; 3600, the default) and `outbox_days` (for how many days; 7, the default), and the `map_drawing.`*context* lines **tui** writes itself (see MAP). `$LNMSG_HOME/contacts` holds your own word on peers, one a line, `#` a comment: `name` *address* *petname* (the rest of the line is the name) and `block` *address*; a line that is neither stops **tui** with the file and line named. The palette's `rename`, `block` and `unblock` write it, through a rename, so a crash leaves the old file. See NAMES.

On a client, `$LNMSG_HOME/home-client` names the Loquax Mailbox (its public key; delete it, and the device is a messenger of its own again), `$LNMSG_HOME/device-identity` is the device's own identity, which the mailbox admitted, and `$LNMSG_HOME/home-cursor` the last archive entry pulled, moved only after what was pulled is in the history. `$LNMSG_HOME/propagation_node` is the propagation node an earlier run adopted or you named with **--pn**, one line: its hash and `adopted` or `user`; a start finds it under its old name `$LNMSG_HOME/mailbox` and renames it once. On a mailbox, `$LNMSG_HOME/delivery.lock` is held by whichever of the mailbox and the messenger runs, so the other refuses to start; **send** and **fetch** hold it shared for their run.
