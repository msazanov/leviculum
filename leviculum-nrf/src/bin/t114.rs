//! Firmware entry point for Heltec Mesh Node T114
//!
//! Runs a Reticulum transport node with three interfaces:
//! - Interface 0: USB CDC-ACM serial (HDLC framing) to host
//! - Interface 1: SX1262 LoRa radio
//! - Interface 2: BLE peripheral (Columba v2.2 protocol)
//!
//! The transport engine routes packets between all interfaces. The node
//! loop is the shared one (`leviculum_nrf::node_loop`, #469 step 7); this
//! file is the T114's wiring between its calls.
