//! SenseCAP T1000-E pin mappings and transceiver facts (Codeberg #406)
//!
//! A card-sized tracker: an nRF52840 and a Semtech LR1110 (LoRa plus GNSS
//! and WiFi scanning, of which this firmware uses the LoRa modem only),
//! an Airoha AG3335 GNSS receiver (driven since #456), a QMA6100P
//! accelerometer (read as moving/still since #457), a buzzer, one LED and
//! one button. No display. It is the first board on this firmware
//! whose radio is not an SX1262, so it is also the first one driven
//! through `leviculum_lr11xx` (`crate::radio` picks the driver for the
//! `bsp-t1000e` build). Same Adafruit nRF52 bootloader family as the other
//! boards: measured on the rig unit (2026-10-18), Board-ID
//! `nRF52840-T1000-E-v1`, SoftDevice S140 7.3.0, bootloader USB 2886:0057.
//!
//! # Every wiring fact here is a foreign-firmware hint
//!
//! Seeed does not publish the T1000-E schematic (the wiki page
//! <https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/t1000_e_intro/> links no design files;
//! checked for the review of Codeberg #451). So nothing below has the
//! standing of a schematic citation, which is the reference this tree
//! holds board files to: the pins come from Meshtastic's board definition,
//! `variants/nrf52840/tracker-t1000-e/variant.h`, and the RF switch table
//! from `rfswitch.h` beside it, with the Seeed wiki corroborating the pin
//! list. Each alias names the `define` it was read from, and
//! `leviculum-nrf/reference-pins.toml` records the LoRa set so
//! `scripts/check-nrf-board-pins.sh` re-reads that header whenever a
//! Meshtastic tree is present.
//!
//! # What first boot refutes
//!
//! The saving grace of an LR1110 is that a wrong transceiver guess fails
//! loudly in `init_radio`: after `Calibrate` the driver reads `GetErrors`
//! and refuses a nonzero word as `Calibration(errors=0x....)`, which the
//! LoRa task prints as `[LORA] init FAILED: ...`. The two guesses in
//! [`LR1110`] that can be wrong and the bit that refutes each:
//!
//! * the TCXO supply (`V1_6`) or its start-up time (300 steps, ~9 ms):
//!   `HF_XOSC_START`, bit 5, `errors=0x0020`. A wrong voltage usually,
//!   a start-up time too short sometimes; raise the steps before doubting
//!   the voltage, since the voltage is the one fact the variant states
//!   (`LR11X0_DIO3_TCXO_VOLTAGE 1.6`).
//! * a 32.768 kHz crystal on DIO10/DIO11 (`LfClk::Xtal`, waited for):
//!   `LF_XOSC_START`, bit 6, `errors=0x0040`. Then the crystal is absent
//!   and the answer is `LfClk::Rc` with `wait_32k_ready: false`.
//!
//! This is the procedure the driver's README documents for the ThinkNode
//! M9 ("Worked example"), where both `Rc` and `Xtal` came up clean. The
//! regulator guess (`DcDc`) is not refuted by `GetErrors`: a board without
//! the inductor runs, badly. It is what Meshtastic sets on every LR1110
//! variant (`src/mesh/LR11x0Interface.cpp:122-124`, "currently all LR1110
//! variant files use the DC-DC regulator option"), which is the best
//! evidence available until a schematic or a current measurement.
//!
//! Note what the variant's `USE_LFXO` is NOT: it selects the nRF52840's own
//! 32 kHz crystal for the MCU's LF clock, a different crystal on a
//! different chip, and says nothing about the LR1110's DIO10/DIO11. The
//! `Xtal` guess rests on the LR1110's GNSS engine, which needs a 32 kHz
//! reference and which this product ships with; it is a guess, and the bit
//! above is how it gets checked.
//!
//! # Transmit power is unverified
//!
//! No Seeed PA characterisation exists that we could find, so the PA table
//! is the Semtech LR1110MB1DXS shield's (same part, same two-PA
//! architecture). The power this board radiates for a configured number is
//! therefore **unverified until a rig measurement**. What keeps that honest
//! in the meantime is the clamp-and-announce contract (#349): the
//! `[SX_TX_POWER]` line states the request, the `SetTxParams` byte and the
//! four `SetPaCfg` bytes of the row that went out, so a capture says which
//! row of which table a number came from.
