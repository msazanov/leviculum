//! BLE for the nRF52840 + S140, split along the protocol-reuse seam.
//!
//! # The seam (#255 phase A)
//!
//! Everything the board does over Bluetooth today speaks **one** wire
//! protocol — Columba v2.2 — but almost none of the machinery under it
//! is specific to that protocol. The roadmap's next BLE carrier
//! (`ble_leviculum`: BT5 extended-advertising broadcast on Coded PHY,
//! `docs/ble5-broadcast-protocol3-spike.md`) reuses the machinery and
//! replaces the protocol, so the two are separated here rather than
//! after the fact:
//!
//! - [`columba`] — **the protocol.** The GATT service layout and its
//!   UUIDs (`37145b00-…`), the 16-byte identity handshake, the 1-byte
//!   keepalive, the advertisement contents including the v0.3.0
//!   capability record, and (since phase B) the scanner, the MAC-sorting
//!   connection rule with its v0.3.0 override, and the GATT-client
//!   central path that mirrors the peripheral one.
//! - this module and [`notify`] — **protocol-neutral.** SoftDevice
//!   bring-up and its RAM-floor guard, the `Irqs` binding, the SoC-event
//!   task, the per-connection HVN drain table (whose claim index doubles
//!   as the link identity), the per-link outbound queues and the fan-out
//!   that places each outbound packet on the link of the peer the core
//!   addressed it to — or, for a broadcast, on every live link (#376) —
//!   and the fragment pump that walks [`leviculum_ble_tx::PacketTx`]
//!   over a GATT notify handle. The node-facing channels and the
//!   `Interface` implementation live above the seam since 999
//!   (`leviculum_firmware::ble_link`), the node's link table since 1003;
//!   this backend reports through
//!   [`leviculum_firmware::seams::BleLinkEvent`] and implements
//!   [`leviculum_firmware::seams::BleLink`] ([`SoftDeviceLink`]) over its
//!   slot map.
//!
//! The acceptance test for the split is that a sibling `ble_leviculum`
//! could be added without touching [`columba`]. What such a sibling
//! would still have to reach across the seam for is recorded honestly:
//!
//! 1. [`init`] spawns the Columba tasks by name (via `columba::spawn`,
//!    which since phase B spawns both the peripheral and the central
//!    half behind the one entry point). A second carrier means a second
//!    spawn here — a one-line edit in the neutral module, not a change
//!    to the protocol one.
//! 2. `on_notify_tx_complete` is a method on the `Server` trait, so it
//!    is implemented on whatever concrete GATT server the protocol
//!    defines. The *routing* it performs is neutral ([`HVN_DRAIN`]); the
//!    obligation to call it belongs to each protocol's server.
//! 3. `leviculum_core::framing::ble` is filed as neutral shared framing,
//!    but its fragment header and `KEEPALIVE_BYTE` are Columba wire
//!    specifics. A broadcast carrier with its own framing would not
//!    reuse it, and would not need to: nothing in this module or in
//!    [`notify`] refers to it.
//! 4. The advertisement is built with `LegacyAdvertisementBuilder`,
//!    which is legacy-PDU-only. Extended advertising is a different
//!    nrf-softdevice API and a different `adv_set_count`; the config
//!    below is where that lands.
//!
//! # Architecture notes (carried over from the trouble-host migration)
//!
//! - One task per link: each of the `PERIPH_LINKS` peripheral tasks'
//!   `peripheral::advertise_connectable` produces a Connection (the
//!   tasks serialize on one advertising lock — the SoftDevice runs a
//!   single advertising set — so exactly one free task advertises at a
//!   time and a connect hands the lock to the next free one, #372),
//!   then `gatt_server::run(&conn, &server, |evt| { ... })` drives a
//!   callback closure for incoming writes. Outgoing notifications use
//!   `gatt_server::notify_value(conn, handle, &data)` sync, one fragment
//!   at a time, flow-controlled against the SoftDevice's per-connection
//!   HVN queue (see [`notify`]). The central task (phase B) holds the
//!   same shape with the GATT roles mirrored. Concurrent inbound +
//!   outbound is via embassy_futures::select inside the connection
//!   lifetime; each task carries at most one connection, which is what
//!   holds `conn_count` = `CONN_COUNT` structurally.
//! - SoftDevice owns RADIO/TIMER0/RTC0/etc.; we don't bind those.
//!   USB VBUS detect goes via `SoftwareVbusDetect` fed by SoC events.
