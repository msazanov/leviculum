//! The board's `/status` responder — `rnstatus -R <board>` (Codeberg #235).
//!
//! The core already does the front half: it registers
//! `rnstransport.remote.management`, gates `/status` behind the USB-loaded
//! allow-list, and raises `NodeEvent::RequestReceived` for a request that
//! passed both (`leviculum-core/src/node/mod.rs:792`). Until this module
//! nothing on the board answered that event, so a query got path, link,
//! accepted identify — and then a timeout.
//!
//! # Why not the host responder
//!
//! `leviculum-std`'s `driver::remote_mgmt::RemoteMgmtResponder` answers the
//! same event on a PC, and the instruction for this batch was to share it if
//! sharing was possible. It is not, and the reason is not stylistic: that
//! responder's bundle comes from `rpc::handlers::build_interface_stats`, which
//! walks a `SharedInventory` of listeners and their spawned children, reads a
//! `Mutex`-guarded `InterfaceStatsMap` of `std` atomics, clones IFAC configs
//! into a `BTreeMap`, and returns a `serde_pickle::Value`. Every one of those
//! is `std`, and the world it describes — listeners, spawned client
//! connections, local IPC peers — does not exist on a board with three fixed
//! interfaces.
//!
//! What IS shared is the part that decides the wire format:
//! [`leviculum_core::status_bundle`] owns the key set, the key order and the
//! encoding, tested byte-for-byte against the reference packer, and
//! [`leviculum_core::node::remote_status`] owns which event is a `/status`
//! request (exact management destination and path, decided before any row is
//! built) and how the answer leaves (a packet, or a response Resource only
//! when the packet refuses the size). This module only fills in the board's
//! three rows. When `leviculum-std`'s builder is next touched, that is the
//! seam to move it onto.
