//! The players of the one-button feedback grammar (#459, order 892): the
//! board's LED, its notification LED where it has one, and the T1000-E's
//! buzzer, each playing a [`leviculum_feedback::Pattern`] to its end.
//!
//! The patterns, their timings and the phase a pattern is in at a given
//! millisecond are `leviculum-feedback`'s, host-tested there. This module
//! owns the pins and the three signals that hand a pattern to a player. A
//! pattern raised while another is playing on the same sink replaces it:
//! the player starts the new one from its first step and the rest of the
//! old one is never played.
//!
//! | Board | `sink=led` | `sink=notify` | `sink=buzzer` |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | WisMesh Pocket V2 | green LED1, between its TX activity pulses | blue LED2, between its RX activity pulses | none |
//! | T1000-E | the green LED | none, `notify` plays on the LED | P0.25 at `BUZZER_TONE_HZ` |
//! | Heltec T114 | the green LED (active low) | none, `notify` plays on the LED | none |
//! | Solar Node | the green LED | the blue LED | none |
//!
//! Every play writes one line when the player starts it, through the
//! gated path, not the critical one:
//!
//! ```text
//! FEEDBACK pattern=<name> sink=led|notify|buzzer t=<ms>
//! ```
//!
//! A status press on a board with no battery percentage plays nothing and
//! writes `FEEDBACK pattern=none reason=no-percentage sink=led` instead.
//!
//! A sink a board does not have is never asked, so it writes no line.
//!
//! Which event raises which pattern on which sink is
//! `leviculum_firmware::feedback`'s since #469 973; this module is the
//! other side of its `Sinks` seam:
//! [`NrfSinks`](crate::feedback::NrfSinks), registered at boot with
//! `leviculum_firmware::feedback::set_sinks`, hands a pattern to the
//! player of its sink.
