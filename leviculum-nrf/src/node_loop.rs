//! The node loop, once (#469 step 7, order 1085): the skeleton every board
//! binary runs, from `embassy_nrf::init` to the main loop's last arm.
//!
//! `docs/drafts/node-loop-diff-2026-10.md` diffed the four binaries line by
//! line: about 705 of about 840 code lines a file were one skeleton, and
//! every other line is a board fact or a behaviour decision Lew has taken
//! (D1 to D7, 2026-10-28). This module is that skeleton; a binary is the
//! board's wiring between its calls. The calls, in the order a binary makes
//! them, with the board's own steps between them:
//!
//! 1. [`enter`]: the boot record, the HAL, the heap, the previous boot's
//!    post-mortems, the stack paint. The binary then sets its panic LED.
//! 2. [`pre_usb`]: IRQ priorities, the set-once registrations, the pre-USB
//!    flash reads, USB. The binary then prints its boot line.
//! 3. [`boot_banner`]: `[FW_BUILD]`, `[TIME_SOURCE]`, the GNSS presence
//!    anchor (D2) and the boot diagnostics. The binary then raises its
//!    rails and takes its LED.
//! 4. [`build_node`]: identity, builder, heap budget, time floor, the
//!    management banner, the interfaces, `LNode started`. The binary then
//!    states its QSPI part, brings its radio up and prints the part.
//! 5. [`lora_up`]: the radio profile and the LoRa spawn decision.
//! 6. [`ble_up`]: BLE, the media and name banners, the flash-backed store
//!    tasks. The binary then spawns its peripheral tasks.
//! 7. [`log_post_init`]: the heap and stack lines. The binary then hands
//!    its LEDs to the feedback grammar.
//! 8. [`run`]: telemetry, the propagation role, the announce gate, and the
//!    main loop, which never returns.
//!
//! The T114 is the first binary on it (order 1085); the solar node, the
//! T1000-E and the RAK4631 follow one order each. Until they have moved,
//! their binaries still carry their own copy of everything here.
