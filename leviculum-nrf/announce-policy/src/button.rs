//! What a press of a board's user button means (Codeberg #459, the
//! gestures of `docs/src/concepts/one-button.md`).
//!
//! A settled press becomes one of four gestures ([`Gesture`]): a short
//! press, a double press, a long press (held [`LONG_PRESS_MIN_MS`] or
//! more) and a very long one (held [`HOLD8_MIN_MS`] or more). The double
//! press sends the board's own announces, the delivery destination and the
//! propagation node destination, so somebody holding the board can make it
//! findable now instead of waiting out the cadence. The short press is
//! status; the long and the very long press are recognised and reported,
//! and get their meaning from the passes that build the mode switch and the
//! power off.
//!
//! Three gates stand between a contact and a gesture, and all three are
//! here because all three are timing that a thumb on a board cannot
//! reproduce:
//!
//! * [`Debouncer`]: a contact chatters for a few milliseconds on each edge,
//!   and every chatter is a GPIOTE edge. A level counts once it has held
//!   for [`BUTTON_DEBOUNCE_MS`] with no further edge.
//! * The double-press window: a short press is reported only once
//!   [`DOUBLE_PRESS_WINDOW_MS`] has passed after its release without a
//!   second press, so a double is never first reported as a short.
//! * [`PressLimiter`]: a double press announces at most once every
//!   [`BUTTON_ANNOUNCE_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`]; one inside the window is reported
//!   and dropped, never queued.
//!
//! [`ButtonGate`] is the three in the order the board runs them, and the
//! board does nothing with a press that this module did not decide.

/// How long a level must hold with no further edge before it counts.
///
/// Mechanical tact switches of the kind on these boards bounce for a few
/// milliseconds, rarely past 10 ms, and a press a person means lasts well
/// over 100 ms. Fifty sits between the two with margin on both sides: long
/// enough that the worst bounce is absorbed, short enough that no deliberate
