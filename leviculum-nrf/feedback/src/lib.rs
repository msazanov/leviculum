//! The one-button feedback grammar as on/off patterns (Codeberg #459,
//! order 892; the grammar is `docs/src/concepts/one-button.md`).
//!
//! | signal | pattern | constructor |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | three short | Tracker | [`mode`]`(Mode::Tracker)` |
//! | one long | Mesh | [`mode`]`(Mode::Mesh)` |
//! | *n* short | battery, in quarters | [`battery_quarters`] |
//! | fast flicker | error | [`error`] |
//! | one short | a message for the user arrived | [`notify`] |
//! | one blip | a held button has reached 2 s: release now | [`release_now`] |
//! | two short | the report a double press sent was proven delivered | [`report_delivered`] |
//! | one short, one blip | the announces a double press made have left the radio | [`announce_sent`] |
//!
//! A [`Pattern`] is a short list of [`Step`]s, each an on time and the
//! off time after it, and it is the same list for every sink: the LED, the
//! notification LED and the T1000-E's buzzer play one pattern the same way,
//! the buzzer by sounding its tone where the LED lights. The firmware's
//! players (`leviculum-nrf/src/feedback.rs`) drive a pin from a
//! [`Playback`]; which phase a pattern is in at a given millisecond is
//! decided here, where it can be asserted without a board.
//!
//! When `announce-sent` plays is [`AirWatch`]'s decision, host-tested here
//! for the same reason.
//!
//! Every pattern is a `static` list, so a `Pattern` is two words and can
//! be handed to a player through a signal without a copy of its steps.
