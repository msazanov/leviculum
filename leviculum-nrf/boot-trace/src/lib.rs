//! Boot-phase breadcrumb record for the noinit-RAM boot trace
//! (bug ledger local-pocket-dark-d66209e).
//!
//! A board that dies during boot before USB comes up is invisible from
//! outside: no enumeration, no log, no post-mortem — the capture shows
//! nothing at all. The breadcrumb record closes that gap. The firmware
//! keeps a tiny fixed-layout record in a `.uninit` section (NOLOAD in
//! cortex-m-rt's link.x, so soft and pin resets preserve it; power loss
//! does not), advances a phase byte at named boot milestones, and on
//! every boot reads the PREVIOUS record before overwriting it. The
//! resulting `BOOT_TRACE` line says exactly how far the dying boot got —
//! the button reset that recovers the board delivers the evidence.
//!
//! This crate is the pure, host-testable half: record layout, magic
//! handling, phase names, RESETREAS decode, and the byte-exact shape of
//! the emitted line. The volatile `.uninit` I/O stays in
//! `leviculum-nrf/firmware/src/boot_trace.rs`; the firmware crate cross-compiles
//! and runs no host tests, so everything greppable is asserted here
//! (same split as `leviculum-log-line`).
//!
//! The panic and HardFault post-mortems, the other two records in
//! `.retained`, have their decisions in [`postmortem`]; the persistent log
//! tail beside them, and the runtime log ring, in [`tail`].
