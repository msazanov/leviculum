//! The BLE link's node side (step 4 of
//! `docs/src/concepts/firmware-layers.md`; the values 998, the messages
//! and the `Interface` implementation 999, the link table and the fan-out
//! loop over `trait BleLink` 1003).
//!
//! The value half is what the measurement of step 4's call surface found
//! to be the orchestration's half of the seam that is **not** a message:
//!
//! * **the carrier gate** — the BLE on/off the media profile pushes
//!   ([`set_active`]) and every backend task reads back ([`carrier`],
//!   [`carrier_on`], [`carrier_off`]). Until this slice the backend read
//!   the media profile upward (`media::ble_active`) on every gate step;
//!   now the value is pushed down on the three transitions the profile
//!   has (boot declare, boot narrowing, a host apply) and the latches
//!   live beside it.
//! * **the pacing value** — the operator's inter-packet-gap override
//!   ([`set_tx_gap_ms`]), pushed by the control task and read by the
//!   backend's pumps at each packet.
//! * **the drain table** — the per-connection HVN drain table
//!   ([`HVN_DRAIN`]), whose claim index is the per-link identity
//!   everything else is keyed by; its `claimed()` is the "live links"
//!   fact the status page and the control report read, connections that
//!   have not presented an identity yet included.
//! * **the heap-census facts** — the per-link and per-channel held-bytes
//!   mirrors the backend publishes and the census line reads
//!   ([`session_census`], [`defrag_held_bytes`]).
//!
//! The message half (999) is [`crate::seams::BleLinkEvent`]: the peer
//! transitions and the completed inbound packets, which the backend
//! hands to [`deliver`] and the node loop reads from [`channels`]; the
//! outbound packets ride the same struct's sender, consumed by the
//! backend through [`run_fanout`], which hands each one to the backend's
//! [`BleLink::send`]. The BLE [`Interface`] implementation
//! ([`BleInterface`]) lives beside the channels it feeds.
//!
//! The node's link table (1003) is [`LinkTable`]: the peers as the node
//! sees them (identity, our role, since when), fed by the
//! [`BleLinkEvent::PeerUp`]/[`BleLinkEvent::PeerLost`] reports at
//! [`deliver`], read by [`BleInterface::peer_count`]. The slot map (which
//! connection carries which identity, and the duplicate rules that pick
//! one of two) stays in the backend, the one place that sees links.
//!
//! The backend below (`leviculum-nrf`'s `ble/`: the SoftDevice bring-up,
//! advertising, scanning, GATT, the notify pump, the defragmenters)
//! publishes into and reads from this module by direct call — per
//! fragment on the hot path, which is why the value half is values and
//! not channel messages (the per-packet decision of 998: every operation
//! here is one atomic access, and the packets themselves already ride
//! the node-facing channels).
