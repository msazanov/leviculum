//! The one-button feedback grammar's policy half (#459, order 892; moved
//! here in #469 973): which pattern a status press, a long press, a message
//! for the user, a delivered report and a double press's announce raise,
//! and on which sinks. The patterns, their timings and the air watch are
//! `leviculum-feedback`'s; the players that drive the pins with them stay
//! with the bind crate, behind [`Sinks`].
//!
//! What raises a pattern: [`status`] (a short press, after the display
//! wake), [`release_now`] (a held button reaching 2 s), [`notify`] (the
//! propagation role storing a message for this board's own `lxmf.delivery`
//! destination), [`report_delivered`] (the proof of the report a double
//! press sent, order 914) and the air watch of a double press
//! ([`announce_press_begin`], [`announce_press_end`], order 930), which
//! raises `announce-sent` when the LoRa task settles the press's last
//! announce keyed ([`lora_packet_settled`]). The mode blink
//! ([`leviculum_feedback::mode`]) has no caller until Tracker mode exists.
//!
//! # The sinks are registered once
//!
//! The policy is [`Feedback`], generic over its [`Sinks`], so a host test
//! holds one over `fakes::RecordingSinks` and its
//! own air watch. The board's one instance is [`Feedback`] over
//! [`Registered`], a zero-sized [`Sinks`] that forwards to the
//! implementation the bind crate registers with [`set_sinks`] at boot: the
//! callers that raise a pattern (the button, the LoRa task, the propagation
//! role, the reporter) live in the bind crate today and in this crate after
//! step 5, and name only the free functions below, so neither they nor this
//! crate name a pin. The registration is the shape of
//! [`crate::entropy::set_source`]: two function pointers rather than a
//! `dyn`, which the seam rules exclude. A pattern raised before
//! [`set_sinks`] goes nowhere, as one raised on a sink the board does not
//! have always did.
