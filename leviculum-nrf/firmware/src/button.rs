//! The user button's press handling (Codeberg #459, the gestures of
//! `docs/src/concepts/one-button.md`; moved here in #469 976).
//!
//! What counts as a press, which gesture it is and how often one may
//! announce is decided in [`leviculum_announce_policy::ButtonGate`]; this
//! module times the edges it reads from a [`ButtonInput`] against a
//! [`Clock`], writes the `BTN_PRESS` and `BTN_HOLD` lines, raises
//! [`ANNOUNCE_PRESS`] for a double press, wakes the display where there is
//! one and asks [`crate::feedback`] for the status and "release now"
//! patterns. The announces themselves go out from the node loop, which owns
//! the node and waits on [`announce_press`]. The pin, its pull and which
//! level a press drives stay with the bind crate
//! (`leviculum_nrf::button::NrfButton`).
//!
//! | Gesture | `action=` | Does |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | short | `status` | wakes the display (Pocket V2), then the battery in quarters on the LED and the buzzer ([`Feedback::status`]) |
//! | double | `announce` / `rate-limited` | both announces, at most one set per 30 s, then one position report if a recipient is set (the node loop, on [`ANNOUNCE_PRESS`]) |
//! | long, 2 s | `long` | nothing yet: the mode switch, once Tracker mode exists; the 2 s mark blips "release now" |
//! | very long, 8 s | `hold8` | nothing yet: the power off, once the board can sleep |
//!
//! # The Pocket V2's display
//!
//! Any press lights a dark display, and the display goes dark on its own
//! a minute after the last press; no press turns it off
//! (`leviculum_screen::power::DisplayWake`). The press handling raises
//! `board_state::DISPLAY_WAKE` on every press; `crate::display` owns the
//! state and the timeout. The T114's ST7789 has no power
//! control yet and stays lit, as before.
//!
//! # One registered instance
//!
//! The handling is [`Button`], over a [`Feedback`] and the two signals it
//! raises, so a host test holds one over `fakes::RecordingSinks` and
//! signals of its own. The board's one instance is the one [`run`] builds,
//! over the registered feedback sinks (`feedback::set_sinks`) and the
//! statics; it goes when step 7's node loop holds its own.
