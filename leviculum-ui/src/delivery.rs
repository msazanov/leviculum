//! The delivery glyph table of `docs/src/concepts/loquax-ui.md`, section 2: the
//! one place that maps a message's delivery state to its glyph, its colour,
//! its motion and its ASCII fallback.
//!
//! One table, so the conversation glyph, the detail view and anything else
//! that shows delivery read the same row and cannot disagree. loquax is its
//! first user; lnomad does not draw delivery. The rules the table encodes:
//! green and a check mark appear only on proof ([`DeliveryState::Delivered`]);
//! the mailbox state is a blue house, not a second check; amber hollow `◇`
//! against green solid `✓` mirrors unproven against proven; animation means
//! the machine is working right now, driven by the program's tick, so it
//! freezes honestly if the program hangs.
//!
//! The colours are tones, not RGB: the frontend resolves a tone against its
//! palette.
