//! The command palette's names: the one table a messenger frontend opens
//! with `:` or `Alt-x` and filters as the reader types
//! (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-ui.md`, section 1: "a command palette layered on
//! top, no modes").
//!
//! One table, so the terminal palette and the desktop GUI's offer the same
//! words for the same actions. The program maps a [`Command`] to what it
//! does; this module only names them and filters them. Each name is also a
//! row of the program's keymap ([`crate::keymap::Row::palette`]), which is
//! where its keys come from.
//!
//! `quit` is the only name with a `q` in it, so `:`, `q`, `Enter` quits as a
//! vi reader expects (`docs/src/concepts/loquax-keys-and-layout.md`, section
//! 3); a test holds it.
